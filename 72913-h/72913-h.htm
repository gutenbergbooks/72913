<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;'>ONE OF THEIR ATOMS—OUR UNIVERSE!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The scene outside my window was a chaos: showers
of white sparks were rushing at us. I tried to shout a
warning, but instead I laughed with a touch of madness.
I realized then that these sparks were really stars—and
they were passing through us. I could see their luminous
white points beaming within the vehicle as the stream
flowed through. These stars were mere electrons and our
vehicle comparatively was a puff of vapor.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Racing through the vast depths of space in a vehicle
larger than the universe itself—a fantastic concept and
one that only the mind of a master pioneering science-fiction
writer could conceive and then translate into a
classic tale of exciting adventure in a cosmos <span class='it'>BEYOND
THE STARS</span>.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>I<br/> <span class='sub-head'>“CALLING FOR HELP!”</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>There is a saying in the Service that when Liner
40 N runs late the whole world waits. It may be true enough;
I suppose it is. But to me, as Commander 3 of Liner 40 N
on that night in May, 1998, it was a particularly annoying
truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For I was running late; at the Azores I was a good
twenty-eight minutes behind where I should have been, and
it hardly made things any easier for me to contemplate an
impatient world awaiting me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the way from Madrid our port meter 8 had been giving
trouble. Then at 15 W. I had no sooner left the coast than a
surge of wind from the northwest had swung down upon
us, and I lost a good eight minutes trying unsuccessfully to
climb over it. A mood of ill-nature possessed me. I was just
twenty-four years old, the youngest of the three commanders
who alternated on successive flights of the 40 N; this was
only my seventh circle since promotion from the small equatorial
liner of the East, and running the famous 40 N late
under the eyes of a disapproving world disgruntled me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Meridian 45 W. the connecting Director at New York
called me up. The Northern Express, flying north on Meridian
74 W., was already at New York waiting for me. The
Director wasn’t very pleasant about it. If I held up the express
in its flight over the Pole and down 106 E., every connection
in the Eastern Hemisphere would be disarranged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mercurial screen on my desk glowed with its image of
the director’s reproving face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t expect McIleny to make up your lost time,” he
told me. “Not on a night like this. The Bureau reports head
winds for him all up to Baffin Land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m having a few head winds myself,” I retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I grinned, and he caught my grin, and smiled back
at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do the best you can,” he said. And disconnected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made no ocean stops; but the director at 55 was a fussy
fellow. I was due to pass him at ten thousand feet, to clear
the north-south lanes for the non-stop Polar freighters; and
with this wind and the fog which was now upon me I knew
I would receive a sharp rebuke from 55 if I passed too high.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hum sounded at one of the dozen mercurial screens beside
me. Director 55 already annoyed! But it was not he.
The small rectangle of screen glowed with its formless silver
blurs, took form and color. A girl’s face, ash-blond hair
wound around her forehead, her white throat, with the
square neck of a pale-blue jacket showing. And her earnest
azure eyes searching mine, lighting with recognition as on her
own screen she caught my image. Alice!</p>

<p class='pindent'>My annoyance at the threatened director’s call-down died.
I seized my headphone, heard her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Len?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Alice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been trying to get you all the way from Greenwich.
They wouldn’t let me through, not until I told them it was
important—I had to get you.” She spoke fast against the
moment when the Vocal Traffic Timer would cut her off.
“Len, grandfather wants you to come up and see us. At
once—when you’re through with this circle. Will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw the question on my lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t ask me now—no time, now, Len. But it’s important,
and grandfather .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do you know where I can find Jim? We
want him too, you and Jim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s in the Anglo-Detective Division, London Air Service,
New York Branch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know. But he’s in the air tonight. How can I get
him?” Her smile was whimsical. “When I asked for a tracer,
the Timer over there told me to get the hell off the air. I guess
he thought I wanted to find Jim just to tell him I loved him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her image blurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mid-Atlantic Timer’s voice broke in. “Fifteen seconds.
Last call.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get Jim,” I said hastily. “Bring him with me. Soon as
we can get there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. We’re waiting for you. And Len, you won’t need to
sleep first. You can sleep after you get here. And tell Jim—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A click silenced her. The screen went dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What could she want of me? It was pleasant to have seen
and heard from her, this granddaughter of old Dr. Weatherby.
In the stress of getting my appointment and continuous
examinations and tests between voyages, I had not seen Alice
since leaving the Equatorial Run. Nor Jim Dunkirk either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went after him now. The tracers could not rebuff me as
they did Alice. They found him at last—at 120°E., 85°N. He
was coming up over the Pole, and down Baffin Bay making
for New York. His jolly face, with its ever present grin and
the shock of fiery red hair above it, glowed on my screen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Len, say, it’s great to see you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alice just called me—Alice Weatherby. Doc wants us
both—you and me—something important. Wants to see us.
You off at New York?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet,” he grinned. “Had a chase down through Tibet;
every cursed murderer thinks the grand idea is for him to
swoop it for Lhasa and parts unknown. I have one here, now.
When I get him in his airy cage I’m off duty for a while.
Alice wants us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I don’t know what for. She didn’t have a chance to—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifteen seconds. Last call.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The infernal bedamned it is!” came Jim’s belligerent voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last call, Liner 40 N—limit ninety seconds by general
orders.” The Timer was imperturbably impersonal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But not Jimmy Dunkirk. “You cut me off,” he roared. “I’ll
have the General Inspector tell you who you are in thirty
seconds. This is Chief Dunkirk, Patrol Liner A 22, Anglo-Detective
Division. I’ve got a murderer here—understand?
A murderer! Important official business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the Timer cowed, Jimmy would have talked all night.
But I was on duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” I said. “I’ll call you at your office after you get in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Weatherby wants us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Off, Jim.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was well toward dawn when I hooked up with him;
together we flew up the river, where on the Tappan Zee, at
the northern borders of the city, Dr. Weatherby had his home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice was under the landing stage when we descended in
the hand lift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Len, Jim, I’m glad to see you.” She gave each of us one
of her cool white hands. “Grandfather is waiting to—Jim,
let go of my hand; you’re squeezing my fingers. That hurts!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flung it away. He had always done that with Alice,
to devil her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next time,” she said soberly, “you bow to me. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed gleefully. “Right. Sure, that’s safer when you
look so pretty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was indeed pretty. A tall, slender girl—an inch taller
than Jim. Big, serious blue eyes she had, and that braided
mass of ash-blond hair. She was dressed now in a pale blue
jacket like a tunic, to her thighs, and long silver stockings
from beneath the China-silk trousers that flared above her
knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled at Jim. “I’d never take <span class='it'>you</span> seriously. Dolores
says—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim sobered. “Dolores.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dolores is waiting to see you both. She’s very excited.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolores, the little sister of Alice. I never saw her without
a pang. In this great age of science she is a pathetic example
of what science cannot do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our wonderful, marvelous age of science! We pride ourselves
on it. But this girl had been born blind, and she was
one of those rare cases where all the learned surgeons of our
learned world could not bring the light to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim called, “ ’Lo there, Dolores.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jimmy! Is that you? I’m so glad to see you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>See him! There was, to me, a grim pathos in her conventional
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Len is here too, Dolores,” Alice said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Len? Oh, how do you do, Len?” Her hand reached and
touched my hair in recognition. Then she turned back to
Jim. “I’m glad you’re here, Jimmy. They told me you were
coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swept her up, whirled her through the air like a child,
and set her gasping upon her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, how’s my little friend Dolores, huh? Want to
do that again? Come on!” He whirled her again and panted.
“Getting too big .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all grown up. Say, Len, she’s prettier
every day, isn’t she?”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby was seventy-five years old at this time when
he sent for Jim and me. He met us on the lower terrace of his
home. He was a squat, powerfully thick-set figure, with long
ape-like arms and a thick back slightly humped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His head was overlarge, made to seem larger by its great
mass of iron-gray hair. His face, large of feature, was unlined,
save by the marks of character stamped upon it. A kindly
face it was, smiling with friendship, but always stern in
repose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my boys, you came promptly,” he greeted us. “That’s
fine. Come in.” His huge hands gripped us with a strength
that made Jim pretend to wince and grin mockingly at Alice.
“Come in. We’ll sit in the garden upstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led us up the inclines through his rambling house and
to its roof, where in the starlight we sat on leafy couches in a
garden blooming with flowers, shrubs and coned ferns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was about an hour before dawn, cloudless, moonless—a
brilliant firmament of gems strewn upon their purple velvet.
Venus was rising now to be the morning star and herald the
dawn; red Mars, lying opposite and low, glowed like the
ashless end of a cigarro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below us over the parapet of roof was the crowded
countryside, wan and still in the starlight, with the thread
of river beyond—a river of silver with the blue-white lights
of its boats skimming the surface. A few planes were overhead,
the small local airline from Albany skimming past with
a whir of its fans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby chatted with us, rebuked me smilingly for
running the 40 N late, and listened gravely, with occasional
interested questions, to Jim’s vivid account of his world chase
after the murderer, while Dolores snuggled up against him,
thrilled, and timidly held his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, you boys do have an interesting life. Youth
coming forward. Youth can do anything—the world waits
on youth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It did tonight,” said Alice, with a sly glance at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wondered what Dr. Weatherby wanted us for. He had
not hinted at it. He had spoken of a morning meal, and then
we must have some sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, abruptly he said, “I should not have sent for you
unless it was important. It is. The fact that I need you—” He
stopped as suddenly as he had begun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I don’t know why a great tenseness should have fallen
upon us all. But it did. I felt it. And in the insuing silence
little Dolores left Jim and crept to her grandfather, leaning
against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I began, lamely, “We came, of course—”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby was staring off at the stars moodily, with
a look so far away I could have fancied he was gazing, not at
the stars, but beyond them. And then he tore himself back,
and smiled, lighting a cigarro, flipping the torch at me and
asking me to step on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have so much to tell you,” he said. “I hardly know how
or where to begin. You know, of course, something of my life,
my work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leonard, and you, Jim, I believe you’re familiar in a
general way with what the physicists think of the atom?
Radiant matter—these electro-rays that seem to solve everything
and yet only add to the mystery?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know that savants would tell us that space is curved;
so Einstein told us years ago? Well, <span class='it'>I</span> will tell you this. To-morrow,
after you have slept, I believe I can make clear to
you the real construction of our material universe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hand checked us. “I have been working since 1970
along these lines. Alice recently has been helping me. And
then Dolores—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This child here, in the dark, it has been given her to see
things denied to our science. Years and years ago a scientist
proclaimed that <span class='it'>thoughts</span> themselves are a mere vibration,
like light and heat and sound, and all these mysterious rays
and flying electrons—electricity itself. They are all the same,
though we name them differently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been talking swiftly, but quietly. “Tell them,
Dolores.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A big open space,” she said slowly. “Mountains and a
broad valley. A cliffside. People there on a ledge. A young
man and a young woman, very white and pale, with blood on
the man’s face. They were standing on a height, with a
dark cavern behind them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Other people, or monsters down in the valley: something
vague but horrible as a nightmare with a nameless horror.
And the man was calling, <span class='it'>Help</span>. Not the word. I could not
hear that, but I knew. Calling to me. He keeps on calling.
I can hear him so often. Calling to <span class='it'>me</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said it so strangely. At once it seemed uncanny, weird,
almost gruesome. A thrill very akin to fear ran over me. This
was not science. But Dr. Weatherby’s calm, precise voice was
scientific enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was several years ago. We have found since that she
is receiving thought-vibrations, not from here on earth, not
from the planets, or the stars, but from beyond the stars. The
greater realms out there, suspected to exist for so long, which
now I know and can prove to exist!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice had risen in an excitement, an exaltation. He
went on more swiftly, “But all that is nothing. I wanted you
to come here and help me. Dolores has had thoughts from out
there beyond the stars .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and her own answering thoughts
have been answered. Communication!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I have guarded against delusion! I have sent messages
through Dolores of scientific import, and been answered
with scientific thoughts all beyond this child’s comprehension.
Communications with the great unknown—the infinity of distance
unfathomable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That started a year ago. Now I have done more. I have
learned how to get there. I can transport myself, my girls
and you! I am ready to make the journey now. That is why
I want you, and need you. We are going. We want you to
come with us, out beyond the stars!”</p>

<div><h1>II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE DEAD WHITE THING</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“In the plan of the universe,” said Dr. Weatherby, “we find
a conception gigantic, infinite, and yet it all has a simplicity.
I want most earnestly to have you understand me, Leonard
and Jim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gazed at us with a gentle smile. We had had our
morning meal, and had slept long and heavily, and now it
was evening twilight. We sat in the big livingroom on the
lower floor of the Weatherby home. Dolores, as before, cuddled
against her grandfather’s side. Alice busied about the
house, but presently she joined us. Dr. Weatherby’s manner
was as earnest as his words. He added, looking at me, “I
want to be very clear, Leonard. This thing that we are
to do—this journey, in which if you will not join me I shall
make alone—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the infernal, you won’t make it alone while I’m alive,”
Jim cried. “The detective service loses its best tracker, beginning
right away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby held out his hand. “My boy!” He could say
no more. And on Dolores’ face was a radiance. Then Dr.
Weatherby turned to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you, Leonard—will you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The direct question startled me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would I go out there into eternity? Beyond the stars, into
eternal time, and over space unfathomable, to encounter
what now no human mind could grasp? But, like Jim, I was
practically alone in the world and I was free to make any
decision without fear of hurting others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, to give up my commission, as youngest commander
of the great 40 N, to disappear, lose all I had earned,
gave me pause. To return, perhaps never. Wanderers
beyond the stars! Was this not, perhaps, too bold a thing for
human endeavor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I heard my voice saying quietly, “Why, of course I’m
going with you, Dr. Weatherby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was aware that Alice had come in to sit beside me, her
cool white hand impulsively pressing mine. And Dolores was
saying,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alice, they’re going! Isn’t that wonderful? We’re all going,
just as soon as we can get ready!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“A strange simplicity,” Dr. Weatherby was saying. “First,
let me make this clear: when I say universe—the construction
of our universe—I mean everything that exists, or has, or will
exist, the smallest entity of our infinitesimal atomic world to
the greatest conception of what may lie beyond the stars.
Does that sound complicated? Let me say again, it is simple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned toward us, with his thick, strong hands gripped
in his lap. “I want you to realize first that we are dealing
with infinities. The human mind is so finite, so limited. You
must cast off most of your instinctive methods of reasoning.
You understand me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll try,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded and went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Conceive a void of nothingness. No space, no time, no
material bodies. Just nothing. That was the beginning. Do
not try to wonder <span class='it'>when</span> it was. A billion years ago .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a
billion billion. Not at all. You must not think of when, because
<span class='it'>when</span> implies time. There was no <span class='it'>time</span>. There could be no
time without material bodies to create movement and events.
For time in itself is nothing but the measurement between
events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have then, a nothingness. A vortex. A whirlpool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A vortex of nothingness?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. Why, back in the 1920’s, Leonard, scientists recognized
that the basic entities of matter were only whirlpools.
They hoped then to find some fundamental substance,
like ether. But there is none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A whirlpool, by its very motion, simulates substance. And,
in the last analysis, that is all which exists—an apparent
solidity. Divide anything, probe into anything, you find only
a <span class='it'>motion</span> of something else smaller which is apparently real.
But then take that smaller thing. Divide it. You find more
empty spaces, more nothingness. And other yet smaller things
in violent motion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Leonard, don’t you realize that’s what puzzled scientists?
From 1900 on, they puzzled over it. They found a
solid bar of iron to be composed of molecules. They said:
‘Oh yes, we understand. This solidity of iron is only apparent.
It really consists of molecules of iron with empty
spaces in between them, and the molecules are in motion.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But then, Leonard—this was way back—they suddenly
found that the reality of the molecule was only apparent. It
was just like the iron! Empty spaces, with atoms in motion.
Ah, at last they had got to the bottom of it. Atoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But then they found that an atom was no more a solidity
than the molecule, or the iron bar. Still other spaces, with
other vibrating particles. And fatuously they said: ‘We have
found electrons, revolving around a central nucleus.’ But that
meant nothing, and at last they began to realize it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let your mind leap beyond all that, Leonard. It is too
fatuous to think that each division of matter is the last,
simply because you cannot make another division. Let’s go
back to that original vortex of nothingness. It created an
apparent solidity, exactly as the vibrating molecules of iron
create iron. That’s clear, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said Jim, “how small is this smallest vortex?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby laughed. “It has no size. It is infinitely
small. An abstract quality, beyond human conception. If you
try to name its size, then no longer is it infinitely small. It is
not the smallest vortex; there is no such thing. It is the infinitely
small vortex, which is very different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Conceive, then, this vortex, which creates an apparently
solid particle of matter. I call this particle an intime. This
intime, in turn, with myriads of its fellows clustering about it,
vibrating with empty nothingness between, creates another,
larger entity—another apparently solid substance. And so on
up to what we now call an electron.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “between the intime and the electron, how
many separate densities might there be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An infinite number,” he replied smilingly. “A number that
cannot be conceived. Each has distinct characteristics, just as
iron differs from lead or gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused a moment, but none of us said anything. “With
this conception,” he went on, “we can build the definition that
a material substance is a density of other substances. It
maintains its separate existence by virtue of having around its
exterior an emptiness greater than the emptiness of its interior.
Think of that a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The earth itself is such a density. The space around it is
greater than any of the spaces within its molecules, its atoms,
its electrons—down to its finitely small intimes—to the ultimate
nothingness of which it is composed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is our earth. It is in movement. And another density
near it we call Venus, and another Mars, vibrating with a
space between them. All our starry universe; you see, Leonard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My mind leaped with the thrill of it. The great vault of the
heavens with its myriad whirling stars shrank before my far-flung
imagination into a tiny space teeming with its agitated
particles!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby added gently, “A fragment of iron is microscopically
no different in structure from our starry universe.
The distances between our heavenly bodies compared to the
size of them are quite the same as the distances between
electrons, or intimes, compared to their size. You get my
point?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” Jim exclaimed. “What we call the sky would seem
a solid mass of matter—like a fragment of iron—to some
greater viewpoint?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. Our microscopes show nothing which is actually
more solid than the sky itself. From here, on earth, to the
Milky Way is to us a tremendous distance. But suppose that
we were so gigantic—so vast in comparative size—that we
needed a powerful microscope even to perceive that space.
What would we see? A multiplicity of vibrating particles! And
without the microscope the whole space would seem solid.
We could call it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, say a grain of gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment we were silent. There was to all this an
awesome aspect. Yet its actual simplicity was overwhelming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolores said timidly, “It seems strange that so simple a
thing should have been unknown for so long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” said Dr. Weatherby. “The knowledge came
step by step. It is only the final conception which seems so
startling. To me it is the logical, inevitable conclusion. How
could the facts be otherwise?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always, therefore, we have conceived ourselves and our
earth to be some masterful dividing line between what is
smaller and what is larger than ourselves. That is fatuous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We call the one our microscopic world. The other our
astronomical world. And we sit between them, puzzling over
their difference! They are both one, and we are in them—a
mere step of the ladder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It makes me feel very small,” said Alice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or large,” I said. “According to the viewpoint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I added to Dr. Weatherby, “I realize now why no size,
no motion, no time, nor density can be absolute. Everything
must be relative to something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly,” he nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim was puzzling. “This voyage we’re going to make—beyond
the stars. How are we going to make this trip? What in?
By what method? By the nine airy demons, Dr. Weatherby,
there’s an awful lot you haven’t told us yet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so much,” said Dr. Weatherby smilingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” I interposed, “you don’t need to know very
much, Jim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going in a projectile,” said Dolores. “At least they
say it looks like a projectile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like Mallen’s moon rocket of 1989,” Tim exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby shook his head. “The various anti-gravity
methods devised so far would help us very little, except Elton’s
electronic neutralization of gravity. I use that principle
merely in starting the flight. A trip to the moon, such as Mallen’s
rocket made, had nothing in common with this journey
of ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say Mallen is going himself next year—to Mars,”
Alice remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s see our projectile,” Jim demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a moment,” Dr. Weatherby said. “There is, first, one
conception I want to make sure you have grasped. Forget our
earth now. Forget yourself. Conceive the material universe
to be a vast void in which various densities are whirling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the infinitely small to the infinitely large, they are
of every size and character. Yet all are inherently the same,
merely apparently solid. I will ask you, Leonard, this space
between the earth and Mars—of what would you say it is
composed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hesitated. “Nothingness,” I ventured finally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” he exclaimed warmly. “There is where you fail to
grasp my fundamental conception. The void of space itself is
a mass of particles, a mass of densities, of every possible
size and character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The earth is one; a wandering asteroid is another. And
meteors, meteorites, down to the smallest particles of dust.
And still smaller, are the particles of light, far flung everywhere
through space. Other entities are again still smaller—call
them intimes—down in size to infinity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Space then, you must realize, is not empty. The emptiness,
the nothingness, is only the infinitely small. Ah, I see
now that you begin to understand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said slowly, “I’m imagining space as .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as a jelly. Unsolid,
because we ourselves are more solid, and it seems unsolid
to us. But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if we were less dense, and larger .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
gigantic—” I stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” said Dr. Weatherby, “is precisely the point of view
I’ve wanted you to get. You can understand now why to beings
of some greater outside realm all our interstellar space
would shrink into apparent solidity, and they would call it an
atom.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Conceive yourself now a scientist of that vast universe outside.
You are living on a density—a great conglomeration of
particles clinging together—and you call it your earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One tiny particle of your earth is beneath your microscope.
You call that particle a grain of gold. You examine it.
You find it is not solid. You see ‘empty spaces.’ They are not
really empty, but the particles of matter swimming in them
are too small for you to see. But you do see what you call
molecules of gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You increase the power of your microscope. You examine
just one molecule of this gold. Now you see more supposedly
empty spaces, with smaller whirling entities which
you choose to call atoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You examine one atom. The same result and you call the
still smaller particles electrons. Down and down—who can
say how far? Until, at last, you are looking into one intime.
You see yet smaller particles whirling in space. That is the
space between our stars!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And these whirling points of light—perhaps you can distinguish
no more than a million of them. They are the million
largest, brightest of our stars. You cannot see our own sun;
it is too small. Or our earth—too small. And too dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if you did see our earth, and were a fatuous scientist,
you might say, ‘Ah, at last I have seen the <span class='it'>smallest thing</span>!’
Which is amusing, because our earth has a good many rocks
composing it. And each rock goes down to pebbles, grains
of sand, molecules, atoms, electrons—to infinity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you get the conception now? This whole universe we
see and feel from here on earth, from a greater viewpoint
would all shrink into a tiny, apparently solid particle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can visualize it,” I said. “It’s stupendous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jim interposed, “This trip we are to make—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice interrupted him, explaining, “Grandfather has been
making tests. We have several models; he saved one of them
to show you. We can see it now?” She looked inquiringly at
her grandfather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby rose to his feet. “We’ll try it now. I’ll show
you the model and we’ll send it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” he added. “When you see it start, you will
understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We left the house. Night had closed down, a soft, cloudless
night. Never had I seen the stars so brilliant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby led us up a path, beneath spreading trees,
past gardens of flowers, past his lake with its pool and a
cascading brook for its outlet down the hillside to the Hudson;
past the shadowy landing stage where high overhead my
plane lay moored; up the slope of a hill to a long, narrow
outbuilding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim and I had noticed this building when we landed at
dawn. It was new to us, erected during the year or so since
we had last been here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My workshop,” Dr. Weatherby said as we approached it.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>I gazed at it curiously. It was a single-story building,
without windows, flat-roofed and no more than twenty feet
high. In width, possibly thirty feet, but it was at least five
times that long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It lay crosswise on the hill. At a glance I could not guess
of what materials it might be constructed. Wood, stone,
metal—it seemed none of these. Its aspect was whitish, not
silvery, or milky; rather was it a dead flesh white, with a
faintly lurid cast of green to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the starlight it lay silent and unlighted. But there
seemed to it a glow, as though it were bathed in moonlight.
And then I saw that the glow was inherent in it, almost a
phosphorescence. Abruptly I felt that there was something uncanny,
unnatural about this structure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made no comment. But I saw surprise on Jim’s face, and
at the lower end of the building where there appeared to be
a door, he stopped, irresolute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is the projectile in here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Alice. “Inside. But we’re going to the test room
first, aren’t we, Grandfather?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went through a door and along a narrow passage. It
was dimly illumined by small blue vacuum tubes overhead.
I found myself with Dolores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very wonderful,” she said. “You will see, very soon. Oh,
yes, where is Jim? I want Jim to see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not afraid, Dolores? Afraid of this voyage they
talk about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid? Oh, no!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The passageway widened. “Here is Jim,” I said. “Jim, stay
with Dolores. She wants to show you this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this thing
we’ve come to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We entered a room some thirty feet square. Dr. Weatherby
switched on the lights. There were furniture, rugs, small
tables of apparatus, instruments, and banks of vacuum tubes
on tripods standing about, with wires in insulated cables connecting
them. The cables littered the floor, like huge snakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby drew aside a portiere which cut off a
corner of the room. Lying on a large table, flooded with a
vacuum light from above, was a model of this building we
were in. It was about two feet wide, by ten feet long—the
same dead white, uncanny-looking structure. A thought
sprang to my mind. Was this building we were in itself the
projectile? I think I murmured the question, for Dr. Weatherby
smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Here is a small replica of the vehicle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He unbolted the roof of the model. Resting inside was a
tiny, dead white object some six inches long, cigarro-shaped,
but with a pointed end and blunt stern. It rather suggested
the ancient sub-sea vessels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had fin-shaped projections, like very small wings for its
slow transit through air. A tiny tower was forward, on top,
and there were bull’s-eye windows lining the sides and in
every face of the octagon tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby pointed out all these details to us, speaking
in his low, earnest voice. “I’m wondering, Leonard, and you,
Jim, if you’re familiar with Elton’s principle of the neutralization
of gravity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I said, and Jim shook his head. “Not in detail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1988 Elton perfected it. I knew of it only as an
electronic stream of radiant matter which when directed
against a solid substance, destroyed—or partially destroyed—the
attraction of that other substance for the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll explain it when we get in the vehicle itself,” Dr.
Weatherby said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was connecting wires to the little model building on
the table; and he closed its roof, and opened a wide doorway
at its end. “I am going to charge this small building
with the Elton current. The electronic stream will carry that
tiny projectile with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will be the same as the start of our own voyage,
Leonard, except that with this model, I have intensified the
rapidity of the successive changes. What happens here in
minutes, will take us hours. Sit down over there, all of you.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>We ranged ourselves in the gloom across the room. The
model of the building, with its end doorway open like an
airplane hangar, was pointing past us. Jim and I sat together,
with Alice near me, and Dolores by Jim. He put his arm
around her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment, and then Dr. Weatherby touched a switch. The
room was plunged into darkness. From the table came a low
electrical hum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I strained my eyes. A glow was over there. It brightened.
The little building on the table was glowing with a faint,
blue-white light. A minute passed, or it might have been ten
minutes. I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hum of the Elton current intensified; a whir, then a
faint, very tiny screaming throb. The building was now outlined
completely: a luminous white, shot through with a cast
of green, and red and yellow sparks snapping about it. From
where I sat I could see partially into its opened doorway, as
the interior was not dark. It was glowing inside, and now I
became aware of a very faint red stream, like light, pouring
from the doorway, crossing the room, spreading like a fan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the Elton ray, escaping its bonds, its tiny particles
plunging outward with the speed of light, or more. The red
glow struck the blank, dead white wall of our room, stained
the wall with its red sheen. Sparks were snapping in the air
around me. To my nostrils came a faint, sulphurous smell. My
skin was prickling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look,” whispered Alice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The opposite wall where the red ray was striking, now
seemed glowing of itself, a blank, opaque wall, stained red
by the billions of imponderable particles bombarding it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was no longer an opaque wall. Of itself it was now
glowing, becoming translucent, transparent! The stars! Through
the wall I could see the placid night outside, the dark
hillside, the stars!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I felt Alice’s hand gripping my arm. From the glowing
model on the table, the tiny vehicle was issuing. The dead
white thing. It came very slowly, floating out the doorway, as
though drawn by the red diverging stream of light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly it passed me, ascending a trifle, no longer dead
white, for it was transfigured—alive now, shimmering, its outlines
wavy, unreal. It moved a trifle faster, came to the wall
of the room, passed through it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch,” breathed Alice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vehicle—that tiny oblong shape smaller than my
hand—was outside over the treetops, plunging onward in the
red stream of light. Yet at that distance I could see it plainly,
its image as large as when it was a few feet from my face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And suddenly I realized I was staring after a thing gigantic.
It showed now far over the hilltop. I could have sworn it was
but some great air liner. A patch of stars was blotted out
behind it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another moment; the silver thing off there was far away.
Was it as far as the moon? It was larger now than the moon
would have seemed, hanging out there!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I watched. I could still see it as plainly as when it started.
But then suddenly came a change. Its image became fainter,
thinner, and rapidly expanding. There was a faint image of it
out there in the heavens, an image larger than the hillside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an instant when I fancied that the image had
expanded over all the sky—a wraith, a dissipating ghost of
the projectile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was gone. The stars gleamed alone in the deep purple
of the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A click sounded. The hum of the Elton ray died into
silence. The luminous wall of the room sprang into opaque
reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat up, blinking, shivering, to find Dr. Weatherby standing
before me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, Leonard, is the start. Shall we see the vehicle
itself?”</p>

<div><h1>III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>LAUNCHED INTO SPACE!</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>We were to leave at dawn, and during that night a thousand
details ended our attention: Jim’s resignation from the service,
which he gave to the superior through verbal traffic department
without so much as a word of explanation; my own
resignation, leaving the post of Commander 3 of the 40 N
temporarily to Argyle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Temporarily! With what optimism I voiced it! But there
was a queer pang within me, an exaltation—which I think
was as well a form of madness—was upon us all. This thing
we were about to do transcended all our petty human affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was standing at the door of the workshop, gazing at a
tree. Its leaves were waving in a gentle night breeze, which
as I stood there fanned my hot, flushed cheeks with a grateful
coolness. I found Alice beside me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m looking at that tree,” I said. “Really, you know I’ll
be sorry to leave it. These trees, these hills, the river—I
wouldn’t like to leave our earth and never come back, Alice.
Would you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said. Her hand pressed mine; her solemn blue
eyes regarded me. She was about to add something else, but
she checked herself. A flush rose to her cheeks; it mantled
the whole column of her throat with red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she repeated. “We’ll come back, Len.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby called us. And Jim shouted, “This infernal
checking! Len, come here and do your share. We’re
going at dawn. Don’t you know that?”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not forget the first sight I had of the vehicle. It lay
in the great main room of the workshop. A hundred feet
long, round like a huge cigarro, a dead white thing, lying
there in the glow of the blue tubes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even in its silent immobility, there seemed about it a latent
power, as though it were not dead, but asleep—a sleeping
giant, resting quiescent, conscious of its own strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there was about it too, an aspect almost infernal in its
sleek, bulging body, dead-white like bloodless flesh, in its
windows, staring like bulging, thick-lensed eyes. I felt instinctively
a repulsion, a desire to avoid it. I touched it
finally; its smooth side was hard and abnormally cold. A
shudder ran over me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after a time these feelings passed. I was absorbed in
examining this thing which was to house us, to bear us
upward and away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the vehicle was a narrow corridor down one side.
Corridor windows opened to the left. To the right were rooms.
Each had a window opening to the side, a window in the
floor beneath, and in the roof above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a room for Jim and me, another for Dolores
and Alice, and one for Dr. Weatherby. An instrument and
chart room forward, with a tower room for keeping a lookout,
and a galley with a new Maxton electronic stove, fully
equipped. And other rooms—a food room, and one crowded
with a variety of apparatus: air purifiers, Maxton heaters
and refrigerators, piping the heat and cold throughout the
vehicle. There was a score of devices with which I was
familiar, and another score which were totally strange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby already had the vehicle fully equipped
and provisioned. With a tabulated list of its contents, he and
Jim were laboriously checking the items to verify that nothing
had been overlooked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to know how it works,” Jim had said. “Not
’til after we start. Let’s get going. That’s the main idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Alice took the list. She and Jim went from room to
room. Dolores stood a moment in the corridor, as Dr. Weatherby
and I started for the instrument room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim! Oh Jim, where are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He and Alice are farther back, Dolores,” I said. “In the
galley, I think. Don’t you want to come forward with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess not. I’ll go with Jim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She joined them and I heard her say, “Oh, I’m glad to
find you, Jim. I was a little frightened, just for a moment.
I thought something was wrong here on board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned and followed Dr. Weatherby to the instrument
room.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>We stood before an instrument board of dials and indicators,
with wires running upward to a score of gleaming cylindrical
tanks overhead. A table was beside us, with a
switchboard less complicated in appearance than I have seen
in the navigating cages of many small liners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were chairs, a narrow leather couch across the room,
and another table littered with charts and star-maps. And
above it was a shelf, with one of the Grantline comptometers,
the mathematical sensation of some years back. It was almost
a human mathematical brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under its keys the most intricate problem of calculus was
automatically resolved, as surely as an ancient adding machine
did simple arithmetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby began to show me the workings of the
vehicle. “I need only give you the fundamentals, Leonard.
Mechanically my apparatus here is fairly complicated. But
those mere mechanics are not important or interesting. I
could not teach you now, in so short a time, how to rectify
anything which went mechanically wrong. I shall do the
navigating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, as you will see presently, there is very little navigating
involved. Mostly at the start—we must only be sure
we collide with nothing and disturb nothing. When once we
are beyond these planets, these crowding stars, there will be
little to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shook my head. “The whole thing is incomprehensible,
Dr. Weatherby. That flight of your little model was almost
gruesome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, Leonard. I don’t want it to be gruesome.
Strange, yes; there is nothing stranger, God knows, than
this into which, frankly, I stumbled during my researches.
I’ll try to make the fundamentals clear. It will lose its uncanny
aspect then. You will find it all as coldly scientifically
precise as your navigation of the Fortieth North parallel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lighted my cigarro. “This journey we are about to
make,” he resumed, “involves but two factors. The first is the
Eltonian principle of the neutralization of gravity. Sir Isaac
Newton gave us fairly accurate formulae for the computation
of the force of gravity. Einstein revised them slightly, and
attempted to give an entirely different conception of celestial
mechanics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But no one—except by a rather vague theory of Einstein’s—has
ever told us what gravity really is. What is this
force—what causes this force—which makes every material
body in the universe attract every other body directly in
proportion to the mass and inversely as the square of the
distance between them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leonard, I think I can make it clear to you. There is
passing between every material body, one with another, a
constant stream of minute particles. A vortex of rotating
particles loses some on one side, which fly off at a tangent, so
to speak, and perhaps gains some upon the other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seventy-five years ago—about the time I was born, Leonard—they
were talking of ‘electrons’, ‘radiant energy’, ‘positive
and negative disembodied electricity.’ All different names
for the same thing. The same phenomenon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All substance is of a very transitory reality. Everything is
in a constant state of change. A substance builds up, or it
breaks down. Or both simultaneously; or sometimes one and
then the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Electricity—” I began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Electricity,” he interrupted, “as they used to know it, is in
reality nothing but a concentrated stream of particles—electrons,
intimes, call them what you will—moving from one
substance to join another. Lightning is the same thing. Such
a stream of articles, Leonard, is a tangible manifestation of
gravitational force. They had it right before them, unrecognized.
They called it, ‘magnetic force,’ which meant nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do these streams create an attractive force? Conceive
the earth and the moon. Between them flow a myriad
stream of infinitesimal particles. Each particle in itself is a
vortex—a whirlpool. The tendency of each vortex is to combine
with the one nearest to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They do combine, collide, whirl together and split apart.
The whole, as a continuous, violently agitated stream, produces
a continuous tendency toward combination over all
the distance from the earth to the moon. The result—can’t
you see it?—must be a <span class='it'>force</span>, an inherent tendency pulling
the earth and moon together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough of such abstract theory! A while ago, I charged
that little model of this building with an Elton ray. The
model, and this building itself, are built of an ore of electrite,
the one hundred and fortieth element, as they called it when
it was isolated a few years ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw the model of the building glow? Electrons and
intimes were whirling around it. The force communicated to
the tiny projectile lying inside. In popular language, ‘its gravity
was destroyed.’ Technically it was made to hold within
itself its inherent gravitation and the gravitation of everything
else was cut off. It was, in the modern sense, magnetized,
in an abnormal condition of matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said, “There was a red ray from the little building. The
projectile seemed to follow it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly,” he exclaimed. “That was the Elton Beta ray. It
is flung straight out, whereas the Alpha ray is circular. The
Beta is a stream of particles moving at over four hundred
thousand miles a second. More than twice the speed of light!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He chuckled. “When they discovered that, Leonard, the
Einstein theories held good no longer. The ray bombarded and
passed through the electric wall of the room, and the projectile
went with it, drawn by it, sucked along by the inherent
force of the flying whirlpools. The projectile with its
infinitely greater mass than the mass of the flying particles of
the ray, picked up speed slowly. But its density was lessening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As it gained velocity, it lost density. Everything does
that, Leonard. I intensified the rapidity of the changes, as I
told you. We shall take it slower. Hours, for what you saw in
minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tossed away his cigarro and stood up over the instrument
table. “When we start, Leonard, here is exactly what
will happen. Our gravity will be cut off. Not wholly, I have
only gone to extremes in describing the theory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a lessened attraction from the earth, the moon will
draw us. And passing it, some other planet will draw us onward.
And later, the stars themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He indicated his switches. “I can make the bow or the
stern, or one side or the other, attractive or repulsive to
whatever body may be nearest. And thus, in a measure,
navigate. But that, Leonard, will be necessary for a few
hours only, until we are well out beyond the stars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said it quite quietly. But I gasped. “Beyond the stars
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in a few hours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said. “In our case, differing from my experiment
with the model, we carry the Elton Beta ray, the ‘red ray,’
with us. The gravity principle we use only at the start, to
avoid a possible collision. With the red ray preceding us, we
will follow it. Ultimately at four hundred thousand miles a
second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the source of the ray, <span class='it'>being with us</span>, will give the
ray constant acceleration, which we in turn will attain. Thus
an endless chain of acceleration, you see? And by this I hope
to reach the high speeds necessary. We are going very far,
Leonard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That model,” I said, “grew larger. It spread—or did I
fancy it?—over all the sky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled again. “I have not much left to tell you, Leonard.
But what there is—it is the simplest of all, yet the most
astounding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim’s voice interrupted us. “We’ve finished, Dr. Weatherby.
Everything is aboard. It’s nearly dawn. How about starting?”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The dawn had not yet come when we started. Dr. Weatherby’s
workmen were none of them in evidence. He had sent
them away a few days before. They did not know his purpose
with this vehicle; it was thought among them that he was
making some attempt to go to the moon. It was not a startling
adventure. It caused very little comment, for since Elton’s
discovery many such projects had been undertaken, though
all had not been successful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby’s activities occasioned a few daily remarks
from the National Broadcasters of News, but little else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was, however, one of Dr. Weatherby’s assistants
whom he trusted with all his secrets: a young fellow called
Mascar, a wordless, grave individual, quiet, deferential of
manner, but with a quick alertness that bespoke unusual
efficiency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been on guard in the workshop since the workmen
left. When Jim and I arrived, Dr. Weatherby had sent
Mascar home for his much needed sleep. But he was back
again, now before dawn, ready to stand at the Elton switch
and send us away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby shook hands with him, as we all gathered
by the huge bull’s-eye lens which was swung back to give
ingress to the vehicle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what you are to do, Mascar. When we are well
outside, throw off the Elton switch. Lock up the workshop
and the house and go home. Report to the International
Bureau of News that if they care to, they can announce that
Dr. Weatherby’s vehicle has left the earth. You understand?
Tell them they can assume, if they wish, that it will land
safely on the moon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will do that,” said Mascar quietly. He shook hands with
us all. And his fingers lightly touched Dolores’ head. “Good-bye,
Miss Dolores.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Mascar. Good-bye. You’ve been very good to
Grandfather. I thank you, Mascar. You wait at home. We will
be back soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said. He turned away, and I could see he was
striving to hide his emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swung on his heel, crossed the room, and stood quiet,
with a firm hand upon the Elton switch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim called impatiently, “Come on, everybody. Let’s get
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For one brief instant my gaze through the forward opened
end of the building caught a brief vista of the peaceful
Hudson countryside. Hills, and trees in the starlight, my own
earth—my home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The huge convex door of the vehicle swung ponderously
closed upon us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to the instrument room,” said Dr. Weatherby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We sat on the couch, huddled in a group. The bull’s-eye
windows, made to withstand any pressure, were nevertheless
ground in such a way that vision through them was crystal
clear. The one beside me showed the interior of the workshop
with Mascar standing at the Elton switch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had already thrown it. I could not hear the hum. But I
saw the current’s effect upon Mascar. He was standing rigid,
tense, and gripping the switch as though clinging. And then,
with his other hand, he seized a discharging wire planted
near at hand, so that the current left him comparatively unaffected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still I could feel nothing. My mind was whirling. What
was it I expected to feel? I do not know. Dr. Weatherby had
assured us we would undergo no terrifying experience; he
seemed to have no fear for the girls. But how could he be
sure?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The walls of the workshop now were luminous; Mascar’s
motionless figure was a black blob of shadow in the glowing,
snapping interior of the room. Sparks were crackling out
there. But here in the vehicle there was nothing save a heavy
silence; and the air was cold, dank, tomblike.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Then I felt the current; a tingling; a tiny, infinitely rapid
tingling of the vehicle. It was not a vibration; the electric
floor beneath my feet was solidly motionless. A tingling seemed
to pervade its every atom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I realized my body was tingling! A whir, a tiny
throbbing. It brought a sense of nausea and a giddiness. Involuntarily
I stood up, trembling, reeling. But Dr. Weatherby
sharply drew me back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice and Dolores were clinging to each other. Jim muttered
something incoherent. I met his smile, but it was a very
weak, surprised, apprehensive smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I tried to relax. The nausea was passing. My head steadied.
But the tingling grew more intense within me. It was a humming
now. Not audible. A humming I could feel, as though
every minute cell of my body was throbbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not unpleasant after a moment. A peculiar sense of
lightness was upon me. A sense of freedom. It grew to an
exaltation. I was being set free! Unfettered at last. The chains
that had bound me to earth were dropping away. But the
mood upon me was more than an exaltation, an intoxication:
a madness! I was conscious that Alice was laughing wildly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I heard Dr. Weatherby’s sharp command, “Don’t do that!
Look there; see the red ray?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I clung to my reeling wits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim muttered, “Look at it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interior of the workshop was a whirling fog drenched
in blood. I could see the red streaming out its open doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re moving!” Alice cried. “Dolores, we’ve started!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The enveloping room of the workshop seemed gliding backward.
Not a tremor of the vehicle. Mascar’s figure moved
slowly backward and downward beyond my sight. The workshop
walls were sliding past. The rectangle of its open end
seemed expanding, coming toward us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then we were outside, in the starlit night. A dark
hillside was dropping away. A silver ribbon of river was
slipping beneath us, dropping downward, like a plummet
falling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red ray had vanished. Dr. Weatherby’s voice, calm
now, with a touch of triumph to it that all had gone so well,
said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mascar has extinguished the red ray. We used it only for
starting. We must start slowly, Leonard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The river had vanished. A huge Polar liner—I recognized
its group of colored lights as Ellison’s, flying in the forty
thousand-foot lane—showed overhead. But it, too, seemed
falling like a plummet. It flashed straight down past our window
and disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby went to the instrument table. Time passed.
It seemed only a moment or two though.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolores murmured, “Are we still moving, Jim? You must
tell me. Tell me everything you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was stiflingly hot. We were all gasping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve turned on the refrigeration,” said Dr. Weatherby, “to
counteract the heat of the friction of our passage through the
atmosphere. It will be cool enough presently. Come over here.
Don’t you want to look down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We gathered over the instrument room’s floor window. Stars
were down there, white, red, and yellow stars in a field of
dead black: a narrow crescent edge of stars, and all the rest
was a gigantic dull red surface. Visibly convex! Patches of
dark, formless areas of clouds. An ocean, the vaguely etched
outlines of continents, the coastline of the Americas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were launched into space!</p>

<div><h1>IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>EXPANSION!</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Then the vehicle cooled rapidly. Soon we had the heaters
going. The coldness of space enveloped us penetrating the
vehicle’s walls. But with the heaters we managed to be
comfortable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby sat at the instrument table. His chronometer
there showed 5 <span class='sc'>a.m.</span> We had started at 4 <span class='sc'>a.m.</span> On one of the
distant dials the miles were registering in units of a thousand.
The dial-pointer was nearing XX6. Six thousand miles:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby glanced up as I appeared. Alice and
Dolores, and Jim with them, had gone astern to prepare a
broth. We were all of us still feeling a bit shaky, though
the sense of lightness had worn off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby had a chart on the table. It showed our
solar system. The sun was at its center, and the planetary
orbits in concentric circles around it. The planets and our own
moon and a few of the larger comets and asteroids were all
shown, their positions given progressively for each hour beginning
at our starting time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m heading this way, Leonard. Holding the general plane
in which the planets lie.” His finger traced a line from the
earth, past the moon, past Mars. Jupiter and Saturn lay over
to one side, and Neptune to the other. Uranus was far on the
opposite side, beyond the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby added, “The moon is drawing us now.
But I shall shortly turn a neutral side toward it, and Mars
will draw us. We are more than a freely falling body. We
are being pulled downward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat beside him. “What is our velocity now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gestured toward a dial, an ingenious affair. He had already
explained its workings, the lessening rate of the earth’s
gravitational pull shown by a hair-spring balance as a figure
on the dial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three thousand miles an hour, Leonard.” But as I watched,
the figure moved to 4; and then to 5, 6 and 7.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon, nearly full, lay below us, ahead of us, white,
glittering and cold, with the black firmament and the stars
clustering about it. We were falling bow down. Overhead,
above our blunt stern, the giant crescent earth hung across
the firmament. It was still dull red; its configurations of land
and water were plainly visible. A silver sunlight edged it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, the sun, Leonard!” Abruptly we had emerged from
the earth’s conical shadow into the sunlight. But the heavens
remained black. The stars blazed with a cold, white gleam as
before. And behind us was the white sun with its corona of
flame leaping from it.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>I have said we were falling—our projectile falling bow
down, like a plummet. Gazing through the window it seemed
so. But the effect was psychological. I could as readily picture
us on a level, proceeding onward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as though we were poised within a giant hollow
globe of black glass, star encrusted. There could be no
standards of up, or down; it was all as the mind chanced to
conceive it. But within the vehicle itself, its soundless, vibrationless,
level floor beneath our feet, a complete sense of
normality remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Weatherby,” I said, “that model .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you remember, it
grew gigantic. But we .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we’re still the same size at which
we started?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an hour past, a thousand questions had been seething
in my mind. This navigation of space was clear enough. All
my life scientists had been discussing it. We were moving
now at a velocity of some twelve thousand miles an hour.
But what was that? Less than the crawling of an ant using
the equator of the earth as a race track! Twelve thousand
miles an hour—or twelve billion—would get us nowhere
among the distant stars in a lifetime!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby answered my spoken question: “We are only
very little larger than when we started, Leonard. An infinitesimal
fraction, for our velocity is nothing as yet. I’ll use
the Elton Beta ray once we get farther out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to his switches. Through the window I saw the
firmament swing slightly. He was navigating, heading for
some distant realm beyond all the stars that we could see, all
the stars that could exist out there. This tiny vehicle, threading
its way. How did he, how could he possibly know his
way?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked him bluntly, and he looked up from his chart with
a smile. “Leonard, in five minutes I could tell you every
remaining fundamental of the laws which are governing us.
I will tell you, but I want Jim to hear it too. And I’m absorbed
now in getting out past the asteroids. A little later,
I’ll make it clear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We dropped past the moon at a distance of perhaps a
hundred thousand miles. We were then some two hundred
and forty thousand miles from earth. It was nearly noon, with
the earth standard time of Dr. Weatherby’s home. We had
been traveling eight hours; constantly accelerating, our velocity
at noon had reached a thousand miles a minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon, as we passed it, floated upward with a quite
visible movement. It was a magnificent sight, though the
smallest of telescopes on earth brought it visually nearer than
it was now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We ate our first meal, slept, settled down to the routine
of life on the vehicle. Another twelve hours passed. Our
velocity had reached then a thousand miles a second. But
that was only the one hundred and eighty-sixth part of the
velocity of light!</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were now—with an average rate of five hundred miles
a second from the time we left—some twenty-one million and
six hundred thousand miles from earth. Half way to Mars!
But in four hours more the red planet floated upward past
us. Dr. Weatherby kept well away—a million miles his instrument
showed as he measured the planet’s visible diameter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had now reached a velocity of some twenty thousand
miles a second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall hold it at that,” Dr. Weatherby said. “It’s too
crowded in here, too dangerous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We traversed the asteroid region at about that rate. It was
a tedious, tense voyage, so dangerous that for nearly five
hours one of us was always at the tower window, to avoid a
possible collision. The belt in here between the orbits of Mars
and Jupiter was thick-strewn with asteroids. But none came
near enough to endanger us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We crossed Jupiter’s orbit. Again Dr. Weatherby accelerated
to one hundred thousand miles a second, but it was over
an hour before we crossed Saturn’s orbit, four hundred million
miles further on. We went no faster for a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this velocity it was tedious. Uranus’s orbit at seventeen
hundred million miles from our sun; Neptune at twenty-seven
hundred million. And then that last outpost of the solar
system, Xavion, discovered in 1964. The planet was at the
opposite point of its orbit. We could not see it. Our own sun
had long since dwindled into invisibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last we were away! Launched into the realms of outer
stellar space, plunging onward at a hundred thousand miles
a second. But ahead of us the giant stars showed no change.
As imperturbably distant in their aspect as when we started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We, Jim and I, had had many hours of futile discussion:
some in our own room, but more in the little tower where we
sat on watch, gazing ahead at the motionless stars, our eyes
at the small search-telescopes with which we swept the space
into which the projectile was dropping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had seen many asteroids, but none near enough to be
dangerous. And we passed the hours wondering what it was
Dr. Weatherby had to tell us. How did he know where he was
going? What was his direction? In all this chaos of immeasurable,
unfathomable distance, of what avail to attempt
any set direction? By what points could he navigate? It
was unthinkable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And more unthinkable: we had attained a maximum velocity
of over one hundred thousand miles a second, only a
little more than half the velocity of light. The <span class='it'>nearest</span> star
we knew to be over four light-years away. Light, traveling
one hundred and eighty-six thousand, four hundred miles a
second, took 4.35 years to reach that star. At this rate, we
would take some eight years!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this was the <span class='it'>nearest star</span>! Others were a thousand .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
tens of thousands .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a hundred thousand times farther!
Eighty thousand years, even eight hundred thousand years,
we would have to travel to reach the distant nebulae! And
even then, what realms of dark and empty space might lie
beyond! It was unthinkable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll explain when he gets ready,” said Jim.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>And he did. He called us into the instrument room, shortly
after we crossed the orbit of Xavion. He spoke with a slow,
precise phrasing: the careful phrasing of a scientist intent
upon conveying his exact meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I told you once, Leonard, as a matter of actuality
I stumbled upon this thing—these laws which are to govern
our flight from now onward. They are definite laws, inherent
in all matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are about to undergo an experience stranger, I think,
than any man has undergone before. But not because of any
intricate devices with which I have equipped this vehicle.
Not at all. Merely the progressive workings of natural laws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have experimented with them for some years. I think I
understand them, though I am not sure. But their character,
the actual, tangible result of what shortly will happen to us,
that, I understand perfectly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are the laws?” Jim demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gestured. “In a moment, Jim. I will say first that all this
is merely a question of velocity. Matter, as it exists everywhere,
is, as you well know, in varying states of velocity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And as the velocity changes, so does every other attribute
of the substance. A group of electrons inherent in a lightning
bolt, the intimes of a flying beam of light, are very different
in temporary character from those of a bar of iron. But only
different by virtue of their temporary velocity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I make myself plain? Any substance, for a very brief
period, tends to maintain its integrity, its independent existence.
But countless forces and conditions are assailing it.
Wood burns, or rots. Iron rusts. The human body—a conglomeration
of cells loosely clinging into a semblance of an
independent entity—grows old, dies, disintegrates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing is in a permanent state, a permanent condition of
substance. The change may be slowly progressive. Or it may
be sudden and violent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be more specific. The Elton ray, acting upon the sensitive
intimes of electrite, brings a sudden—and to that extent,
unnatural—change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An added velocity was imparted to this vehicle and we
left the earth. The Elton current is operating the vehicle
now. We have reached, or very nearly reached, the limit of
velocity we can attain by using the force of celestial gravity—one
hundred thousand miles a second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I told you, however, we can now use the Elton Beta
ray. Our vehicle, carrying the source of the ray forward,
will presently attain a velocity—” He stopped, smiled gently,
and added, “To our finite minds, it will be infinite. There
will presently be no standards by which we can conceive it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would have interrupted him with a question, but he
raised his hand. “In a moment, Leonard; then I want you and
Jim to ask me any questions you like. All this that I have
said, is prefatory. The question is one solely of velocity. The
rest is automatic. The natural laws governing the attributes
of matter in relation to its velocity are these:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First: A substance whose velocity is increased loses density
proportionately. For instance, our vehicle, I consider it
as a whole, you understand. As its velocity increases, it
becomes less dense in substance. Comparatively less dense.
Everything is comparative, of course. We ourselves have undergone
the same change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A loss of density!” I exclaimed. “Then, of course, expanding,
becoming more diffuse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly, Leonard. And that is the second law. Our <span class='it'>size</span>
is growing directly in proportion to our growing velocity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I grasped it now. An infinite velocity had suddenly been
imparted to the model of the vehicle. It had expanded, like a
puff of vapor, over all the sky! Dr. Weatherby went on in his
same careful voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These two changes—a loss of density and a gain in size—have
been going on ever since we left the earth. They
amount to little as yet. But presently I am going to increase
our velocity immeasurably. External objects—the stars out
there, you will see the change when you look at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you understand me? The principle is obvious. A cold,
dark star is small and dense. And moves slowly. A giant star
is hot, of little density, and it has an enormous velocity.”
He paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim interjected, “I think we understand you, Dr. Weatherby.
With this infinite velocity, we will pass beyond the stars. And
growing in size .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to be gigantic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that, proportionately, the stars will shrink to atoms,”
said Alice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim nodded. “Yes. I understand that. It sort of makes you
gasp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” I exclaimed, “Dr. Weatherby, you have held communication
with other living minds, other beings, somewhere
out here. Dolores’s thought-waves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said. “Thought-waves are infinitely faster than
light. No one has ever—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean,” I went on, “we are hoping to reach those
other beings. But how—this is what Jim and I can’t understand—how
do you know where you are going? Might we not
be heading directly away? Or perhaps Dolores is receiving
the thought-waves progressively stronger and thus guiding us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Dolores spoke up. “It is difficult to receive the
thoughts. There has been no time since we left—” She stopped,
and added, “That makes me realize, didn’t Alice leave us a
moment ago?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Jim. “It’s time for lunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolores left her grandfather’s side. “I must go help her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice had slipped quietly away. Dolores now joined her
in the galley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby went on; “I remember remarking to you,
Leonard, that there would be no need for navigation. We will
grow, with an infinite velocity, to an infinitely gigantic size.
Conversely, all this—” He waved his hand at the window,
the firmament of white blazing suns—“all this immeasurable
space we see out there will shrink to a size infinitely small. It
will, later on, be smaller than our vehicle itself. Smaller
than my body, my hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice rose to a sudden vehemence. “Don’t you get the
conception now? All this, our celestial space, will shrink to a
pinhead—an atom. We will emerge from it into some tremendous
greater emptiness, some greater space. As much
greater as the space of a bedroom interior would be to the
head of a pin lying on a bureau! What matter whether we
emerge on one side of the pinhead or the other? The distance
will be infinitesimal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What matter indeed! I clung to the conception. So simple,
yet so vast! And suddenly there sprang before me a vision of
our little earth back there, already invisible, circling its tiny
orbit, a mere nothing in the cosmos of infinite nature. An
electron! Less than that—the merest infinite particle of an
electron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This whole universe of stars, merely a cluster of tiny particles,
clinging together to form an atom of something else!
And trillions of such atoms making up the head of a pin,
lying on someone’s bureau!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby’s voice quieted. “Suppose ultimately, we
were to cross our atom and emerge in exactly the wrong
direction. We would find no vastly great emptiness, but
merely other atoms like our own, going downward, so to speak,
into the pin’s head, instead of merging from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that cannot happen. Nature, in all its natural phenomena,
always chooses the path of least resistance. We could
not increase our velocity without adequate distance to transverse,
nor increase our size without adequate emptiness to fill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see! We may be going wrongly now. It makes no
difference; the ultimate distance will be infinitesimal. But I
know that by all natural laws we are seeking greater spaces.
We will find, beyond these stars, an infinitely greater emptiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our size ultimately will fill it. But we will have turned
to seek an emptiness still vaster, until, at last, freed from these
clusters of substance which themselves are clinging together
to form that pinhead, we will emerge.”</p>

<div><h1>V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>EMERGING FROM INFINITE SMALLNESS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Alice and I were sitting in the small round tower that projected
some six feet above the top of the vehicle, near its
forward end. Through the windows here—eight of them, and
one above us—the huge, inverted black bowl of the heavens
lay fully exposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Myriad swarms of stars were thick-strewn everywhere.
Freed from the distortion of the earth’s atmosphere, they
blazed like balls of molten fire: white, blue-white, yellow and
red. Red giants and dwarfs, the old and the young, occasionally
a comet with its millions of miles of crescent, fan-shaped
tail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clusters of stars appeared, blended by distance: binaries,
revolving one upon the other, multiple stars; single white-hot
suns, blazing victorious with their maturity. And far off the
spiral nebulae—patches of stardust, suns being born anew,
or complete, separate universes. It was a glorious, awesome
sight!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red Elton Beta ray now preceded us. From here in
the tower we could see it, flashing ahead like a dim searchlight
beam. We had picked up velocity rapidly, had reached
now some three hundred and sixty thousand miles a second,
nearly twice the speed of light. Yet in all this scene, these
whirling stars at which we were plunging, there was no visible
movement. To an ant, crawling along a hillside ledge, the
distant mountains seemed coming no nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dials showed our velocity to have reached very nearly
one light-year per hour. No longer was it possible to use the
unit of miles: our instruments showed now only light-years.
Light travels 186,400 miles a second, and in our earthly
year there are 31,536,000 seconds. A light-year, then—the
distance light can speed in a year—represents 5,883,000,000,000
miles. This sum now was our smallest unit of
measurement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were now 4.25 light-years from earth. Alpha Centauri,
nearest of all the stars to earth at 4.35 light-years, loomed
ahead of us. I stood at one of the forward windows regarding
it. Two stars it is, in reality, for it is a binary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Its components were beginning visually to separate now:
two white blazing suns, millions of miles apart, slowly revolving
upon a common center with a revolution that took
thousands of years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, as I stood there, I fancied I could see them turning!
We were heading directly for them; they were leaping up out
of the void. There was a slow but visible movement throughout
the firmament now. The stars in advance of us were
opening up, spreading apart, drifting past our side windows,
closing together again behind us. Dr. Weatherby was at my
elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall keep away from Centauri,” he remarked. “And
presently, we must go faster, Leonard.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>He went to his instrument table. The red Beta ray preceding
us seemed to intensify a trifle; the firmament shifted
slightly as our direction was altered. As I stood there, in ten
minutes or so, the twin blazing suns of Alpha Centauri came
up and swept past us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hastened to a side window to watch them. Blazing giants
they were, floating off there a million miles away, each of
them so large that our own huge sun would have been a
match flame beside them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But suddenly I wondered, blinked and stared with my
breathing stopped by the shock of it. Were these indeed
blazing giants a million miles off there? Or were they white
points of fire a mile away? Abruptly my whole viewpoint
changed. I saw these stars, all the blazing white points in
the firmament, not as giant suns unfathomably distant, but
only as small glowing eyes quite close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These were gleaming eyes in a black night, gleaming eyes
close around me. Eyes no larger than my own! Our vehicle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
myself—gigantic! I realized it now. All this unfathomable
distance around me had shrunk. I saw our giant vehicle floating
very slowly, very sedately onward between the staring,
crowding eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby smiled when I told him. “It is all in the
viewpoint, Leonard. In my computations I shall cling to the
viewpoint of earth. Miles then light-years. Earthly standards
of time, distance, and velocity. But shortly we shall have to
abandon them entirely. Sit down, Leonard. I want to talk to
you. Where is Dolores?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the galley, I think,” I said, sitting down at the instrument
table beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want Dolores to hear me. I’ve been wondering
whether I should try and have her communicate again with
the outside. It has been a month since we did that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, almost more than any other aspect of our adventure,
interested me. “Tell me about those thought communications,
Dr. Weatherby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing else to tell. There seem to be two .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
shall we call them people? A young man and a girl. They are
in dire distress. The man is intelligent—more so than we are, I
should judge. He was surprised to have us answer him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he know where we are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I think not. But when I told him, he seemed to
understand. Dolores gets, not words, but ideas, which naturally
she can only translate into our English words. But,
Leonard, I do not conceive these beings will be physically
of an aspect very different from ourselves. We are .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so
close to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Close!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled. “Quite close, Leonard. One of them might be
holding us—our whole universe—on the palm of his hands.
An inch from a thumb, a foot from his ear. I was thinking of
that when I was trying to fathom the possible velocity of
thought-waves. It’s all in the viewpoint. His thoughts would
not have to travel far to reach us. His brain gives orders to
his muscles in a fraction of a second over a far greater
distance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dials showed us to be ten thousand light-years from
earth, our velocity fifty light-years an hour, when Dr. Weatherby
called to us all to assemble in the instrument room. Days,
or what would have been days on earth, had passed since
we started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had lost all count, though upon Dr. Weatherby’s charts
the relative time-values were recorded. We ate regularly, slept
when we could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby was tired, almost to the point of exhaustion,
for though Jim, Alice and I alternated on watch in the tower,
Dr. Weatherby remained almost constantly at his instrument
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten thousand light-years from earth! But ahead of us the
star-points stretched unending.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby faced us. “We are not going fast enough.
I have not dared, but now I must. I want you all to understand.
I have had the red Beta ray at very nearly its weakest
intensity. I am going to turn it on full, to the intensity I
used for the model.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will be a shock, but only momentarily. You, Leonard,
go to the tower. If anything too large or too dense for
safety seems coming at us, you can warn me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled. “But we will encounter nothing of the sort, I am
sure. I’ll sit here at the controls. The rest of you I suggest
stay here with me for a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went to the tower. Ahead of us was the faint stream of
the red ray. The star-points were floating past us, opening
to our advance, streaming past, overhead, to the sides, and
beneath, and closing after us. Even with my greater viewpoint,
the points of fire were passing swiftly now. Some were
very near: they seemed like white sparks. I fancied I could
have reached out and struck them aside with my hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby’s voice reached me as I sat in the tower.
“Ready!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I seemed to feel, or to hear, a hum, a trembling. I saw the
Beta ray flashing ahead of us with a deeper, more intense red,
but for a moment it reeled before my gaze. The nausea I had
had at starting from earth recurred. I closed my eyes, but
only momentarily, for the sickness passed as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby’s voice called to me, “All right, Leonard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I responded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene outside my windows was a chaos: flashing points
of fire. How could we avoid them? Showers of white sparks
rushing at us. I tried to shout a warning, but instead I
laughed with a touch of madness. Avoid them! Millions of
them were already colliding with us! Sparks showering impotently
against our sleek electrite sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I realized that these sparks, these stars, were
passing through us! A steady, flashing stream of them. I could
see their luminous white points beaming within the vehicle
as the stream flowed through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stars no longer. Why, these were mere imponderable electrons!
Some were dark, shining only by reflected light-worlds
like our earth. But I knew they were not imponderable
bodies passing through the density of our vehicle. The reverse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was we who were the less dense. Our vehicle comparatively
was a puff of vapor, through which these tiny
bodies were passing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stream of electricity, myriad electrons flowing through a
copper wire, are not less dense than the wire. The electrons
are the densities; imponderable, of a mass imperceptible, because
they are infinitely small. But of a tremendous density;
it is the wire which is ponderous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So now with us, I sat bewildered, for how long I cannot
say. I heard at intervals Dr. Weatherby’s voice: “Light-years
a hundred thousand. One million. Ten. One hundred million.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were a hundred million light-years from earth! The
flashing points of fire continued to stream past. But there was
a change, a thinning in advance of us; a clustering white
radiance behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat motionless, tense. It might have been minutes, or an
hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found Dr. Weatherby beside me, and I turned to him. I
was stiff, cramped and cold. I tried to smile. “We’re all
right .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. still, Dr. Weatherby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look,” he said. “We’re beyond them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A darkness loomed ahead. To the sides the brilliant star-points
seemed rushing together; clustering to form other, fewer
white points. And the whole, sweeping backward into the
seething radiance which lay behind us. Soon it was all back
there, a shrinking white mist of fire; billions of seething
particles of star dust shrinking together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch it, Leonard. It is our universe. Watch it go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We turned to the rear window. Everywhere now was empty
blackness, except directly behind us. A silver mist hung back
there in the void. It was dwindling. Then I saw it as a tiny,
flattened, lens-shaped silver disk. But only for an instant, for
it was shrinking fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lens-shaped disk! A point of white fire! A single faint
star—a single entity! No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not a star; nothing but an
electron!</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a breath I realized how near it was. A single tiny white
spark, trembling outside our window. I could have pinched
it with my thumb and finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It trembled, vanished into blackness.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A day passed, a day to us because we ate our meals, and
slept. But to the worlds, universes outside our windows, congealing
behind us into single points, winking and vanishing
into an oblivion of space and time, this day of ours was an
eternity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our dials had long since become useless, a billion light-years
from our starting point. A billion billion, and even that
dwindling with our changing standards and viewpoint into
a space we could have held in our cupped hands. Of what
use to try and measure it. Or even conceive it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The black, empty firmament had only remained empty for
a moment. Ahead and off to the sides other luminous points
showed. For hours Dr. Weatherby and I sat together watching
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment when a single star gleamed far ahead.
But soon it was a spiral of whirling star dust. It spread to
the sides as we leapt at it. And every myriad particle of it
suddenly showed as a tiny swirling spiral mist of yet other
particles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They spread gigantic, each of them a nebula—a universe.
One of them whirled directly through us, a white stream of
tumbling radiant dust. Behind us it shrank again to a single
point. And the billion other points shrank into one. And the
one faded and was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A night of this. Was our own universe an electron? I
realized it could hardly have been that. Call it an intime.
If we had encountered it now, it would have been too small
for our sight. The tiniest swirling particle flashing through us
now was composed of billions of universes as large as our own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night passed. We sat calmly eating our morning meal.
The human mind adjusts itself so readily! Physical hunger
is more tangible than the cosmos of the stars. Dr. Weatherby
gestured toward the windows where the points of luminous
mists momentarily were very remote.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say that we .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this vehicle is larger than any
intime now. Possibly larger than electrons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soon we will find ourselves among the atoms, and the
molecules. There will then be a change. Very radical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little more coffee, Alice, please. Presently I am going
to try and erect our electro-telescope. Then I must get a little
sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seemed, indeed, upon the verge of exhaustion.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>There was a slow change all that day. These glowing things
we were passing—universes, stars, or electrons or intimes, call
them what you will—they seemed now more uniform; those
at a distance, more like opaque globules, gray. And they
seemed almost solid and cold. Yet it was the illusion of
distance only, for we passed through several of them—streams
of white fire mist as always before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At noon a black void of emptiness surrounded us. It was
the longest, the most gigantic we had encountered, an hour
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then again a point showed. It spread to the sides of us. But
it was different. I could not say how. It was vague, gray. It
streamed past, very distant on both sides and beneath us. At
one moment I fancied it appeared as a distant, gigantic
enveloping curtain, gray and vague. But then I thought it
was a film of tiny globules, solid, entities, unradiant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I called Dr. Weatherby. But before he arrived, the grayness
had all slipped behind us. He saw it as a gray, formless blob.
It congealed to a point. And then it vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was an atom, Leonard,” he said. His voice had an
excitement in it. “That was our first sight of anything of the
new realm large enough to have an identity. Substance,
Leonard! The substance of which our universe, our earth, is
so infinitesimal a part. Everything we see now will be identical
with it. The atoms! We are emerging!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>They aroused me from sleep some hours later, calling me
excitedly. I found them all in the instrument room crowded
around Dolores who was sitting on the couch, her hands
pressed against her forehead. Jim cried; “She’s getting thought-waves,
Len! Some one is communicating with her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby was murmuring, “What is it, Dolores? Do
you get it clearer now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Someone is thinking: <span class='it'>We can see you! We see you
coming!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Dolores. What else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all. <span class='it'>We’re watching! We see you coming!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim murmured in a low voice, “The man on the cliff! The
young man and the girl in distress!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolores shook her head. “No. This is someone else. Closer.
Stronger. The thoughts are very strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you see anything, Dolores?” Dr. Weatherby touched
her, shook her gently. “Try, child. Tell them to think about
themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see—” she stopped, then stammered; “I see .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a light.
A very big light. There are people—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Men. Three or four of them. Sitting near a light. It
shines so white. It hurts.” But she put her hand, not to her
eyes but to her temple. “I’m thinking to them, <span class='it'>Why can’t I see
you? I want to see you!</span> Wait. Now, I understand. He,
someone thinks at me, <span class='it'>Try your telescope! Haven’t you a
telescope? Soon you will see us. We have seen you for a very
long time.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice blurted out, “How long, Dolores? Ask them that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” commanded Dr. Weatherby. “That’s absurd. Dolores—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her hands had dropped from her forehead. “It’s gone.
I’m tired. My head is tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim drew me to the window. “Look there! I was on watch.
When this began appearing I called everybody. But then
suddenly Dolores began getting the thoughts.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The scene outside was wholly changed. Beneath us, to the
sides and ahead, a grayness stretched, a continuous solid
grayness. Elusive, formless, colorless; I could not guess how
distant it might be save that it stretched beyond the limits of
my vision. But ahead and above us, the scene was not gray.
A vague, luminous quality tinged the blackness up there.
Luminous, as though a vague light were reflected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no visible movement anywhere. But presently,
as one staring at a great motionless cloud will see its shape
is changing, I began to see changes. The flat gray solidity
was not flat, but hugely convex. And it was slowly turning.
Huge convolutions of it were, slowly as a cloud bank, taking
new forms. And all of it was slowly moving backward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we came to the end of it. Black emptiness ahead. Behind
us was a gray-massed, globular cloud. Then another, its
twin fellow, came rolling up beneath us in front, spread to
the sides, shrank again behind us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Molecules,” said Dr. Weatherby. “See how they’re dwindling!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw presently, swarms of them, always smaller. And
ahead of us they seemed congealed into a gray solidity—a
substance, it was passing beneath us, and to the sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again quite unexpectedly, my viewpoint changed. I saw
our vehicle plunging upward, its pointed bow held upward
at an angle. A solidity was around us; to the sides, gray,
smooth curtains; overhead a glow of white in a dead black
void.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A black void? My heart leaped. That was not blackness up
there above our bow! It was blue! Color! The first sight of
color. A blue vista of distance, with light up there. Light and
air!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside us the smooth gray walls were smooth no longer.
Huge jagged rocks and boulders, a precipice! We seemed in
some immense canyon, slowly floating upward. But it was a
dwindling canyon. And then abruptly we emerged from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw its walls close together beneath us. An area of gray
was down there; gray with a white light on it. The light
made sharp inky shadows on a tumbling naked waste of
rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gray area was shrinking to a blob, a blob of gray
shining in a brilliant light. Directly beneath us, stretching to
the horizon on both sides, lay an undulating white level
surface. The single blob of gray was down there on it. And off
in the distance, where the surface seemed abruptly to end,
gigantic blurs loomed into the blue sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby was calling me to the tower. I found him
trembling with eagerness. “Leonard, I have the electro-telescope
working. Look through it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I gazed first through the front and overhead tower windows.
The white disk filled a perceptible area of the sky. But
it was not like a sun; it seemed rather a smooth, flat disk
with light behind it, a white disk with a dark narrow rim.
Clear, cloudless sky was everywhere else. And very far away,
behind and above the white disk, I saw a gigantic, formless,
colorless shape towering into the blue of distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look through the telescope, Leonard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I gazed upward through the electro-telescope. Its condensing
lens narrowed the whole gigantic scene into a small
circular field of vision. I gasped. Wonderment, awe swept
over me. The blue sky was the open space of a tremendously
large room: I saw plainly its ceiling, floor and distant walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The giant shape was a man. He was bending forward
over a table—the table was under me. The man’s hunched
shoulders and peering face were above me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant my mind failed to grasp it all. I swung the
telescope field downward, sidewise, and up again. And then
at last I understood. This was a room, with men grouped at
this nearer end of it around the table—men of human form,
intent faces framed with long, white hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The undulating surface over which our vehicle was floating,
was a slide of what seemed glass, a clear glass slide with
a speck of gray rock lying in its center. And the white disk
over us in the sky was the lower, small lens of the microscope
through which these men were examining us!</p>

<div><h1>VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE NEW REALM</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Twenty days! So full of strange impressions I scarcely know
how to recount them. Yet, after such a trip, they were days
of almost normality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our vehicle beneath that microscope had grown rapidly in
size. And with our expanding visual viewpoint, and the nearness
of solid, motionless objects, its velocity seemed infinitely
small. It barely floated past the microscope, settling to the
floor of that huge room; and with a normal proportionate
size, the Beta ray shut off, it came to rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crowded around us—old men, loosely robed, and
with flowing white hair, seamed, sooth, hairless faces, stern,
but kindly, and eyes very bright and intelligent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crowded around us, at first timid, then friendly,
talking together excitedly in a strange, liquid tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby tried to greet them and to shake hands.
They understood neither his words, nor the gesture. But in a
moment they comprehended. And shook hands, all of them
with each of us, very solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room had oval openings for windows; light was outside
but it seemed rather dim. Presently one of the men tried to
herd us along the wall of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” said Dr. Weatherby. “Don’t go! We must stay in the
vehicle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when we turned toward it the men resisted us with a
sudden stubborn force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t!” I shouted. “Jim, stop that! We’d better go with
them.” The old men seemed to have gone into a sudden panic
of violence. They were pushing, shoving us. They obviously
had little strength, but the commotion would draw others
from outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We yielded, and they herded us down the long room. A
panel slid aside. We crossed a long, narrow viaduct, a metallic
bridge with high parapet sides. We seemed to be a hundred
feet in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I caught a vista of low-roofed buildings: verdure—giant
flowers on the roofs, streets down there, and off in the distance
a line of hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The air was soft and pleasant. Overhead was a blue sky,
with gay white masses of clouds. There seemed to be no sun.
The light was stronger than twilight, but flat, shadowless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the opposite end of the viaduct the ground seemed rising
like a hill. A small mound-shaped building was there: a
house with a convex roof which had a leveled platform on
one end, a platform banked with vivid flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed a two-storied building, built of smooth, dull-gray
blocks. Balconies girdled it. There were windows, and a
large, lower doorway, with a broad flight of circular stairs
leading up the hill to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our viaduct led us into the second floor of the house. We
entered on a large room, an oval, two-storied room so that
we found ourselves up on a sort of second-story platform,
midway from floor to ceiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Low couches were here, a row of them with sliding panels
of what might have been paper dividing them. The platform,
this second story, was some thirty feet, broadly oval.
It had a low, encircling railing; a spiral staircase led downward
to the main floor of the apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw furniture down there of strange, unnatural design, a
metallic floor splashed with vivid mosaic pattern, a large gray
frame, ornately carved, with a great number of long strips
stretched across it, strings of different length. It seemed not
unlike an enormous harp lying horizontal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Narrow windows, draped with dark gauze, were up near
the ceiling. They admitted a dim light. This whole interior
was dim, cool and silent. A peace, a restfulness pervaded it.
And our captors—if captors they were—seemed more like
proud hosts. They were all smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when they left a moment later, I fancied that they
barred the door after them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Jim. “I can’t say but that this is very nice.
Let’s look things over and then go to bed. I’m tired out, I
can tell you that. Say, Dolores, it just occurred to me—these
fellows can’t understand a word we say. But you were thinking
thoughts to them a while ago, and you understood each
other. Why don’t you try that now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had occurred to me also. Why had these people understood
Dolores’ thoughts, when her words were incomprehensible?
Were thoughts, then, the universal language? Tiny
vibrations which each human brain amplified, transformed
into its own version of what we call words? It seemed so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolores was clinging closely to Alice’s hand. In these unfamiliar
surroundings she was at a loss to move alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did,” she answered Jim. “I tried .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but there was so
much noise. They could not hear me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try now,” said Dr. Weatherby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will. I am.” She stood motionless, hands to her forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a long silence. Then she said, “I think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes,
someone thought to me, <span class='it'>The Man of Language will come
to you</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all, Dolores?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. That’s all. It’s gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Man of Language!” Jim exclaimed. “An interpreter!
Dolores, what about that young man and girl who were in
distress? They were out here, weren’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I never get their thoughts now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have tried. They may get mine. I can’t say. But they
never answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They brought us food, meals at intervals, strange food
which now I shall not attempt to describe. But we found it
palatable; soon we grew to like it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a man came, whom afterward we learned to call
the Man of Language. He wore a single garment, a queerly
flaring robe, beneath which his naked legs showed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face was smooth, hairless. But the hair on his head
was luxuriant. His head, upon a stringy neck, was large,
with a queer distended look, and with veins bulging upon
his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet withal, he was not grotesque. A dignity sat upon him.
His dark eyes were extraordinarily brilliant and restless. His
smile of thin, pale lips was kindly, friendly. He shook hands
with each of us. But he did not speak at first. He sat among
us, with those restless eyes regarding, observing our every
detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We soon found he knew no word of our language. He had
come to learn it, to have us teach it to him. We were made
aware, later, that all these people, compared to ourselves,
had memories extraordinarily retentive. But this man, he
called himself Ren, was even for them, exceptional. His vocation
was to learn, and to remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began with simple objects: eyes, nose, and mouth.
Hands, a table, a bed. As though he were a child, we
pointed out our eyes, and named them; one eye, two eyes,
a finger, two, three, four fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed like a game. When we told him once, it was
never forgotten. But it was a game which to us, even under
such conditions, soon became irksome. We were impatient.
There was so much we wanted to know. And though we never
tried to leave this building in which we were housed, it was
obvious we were virtual prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ren came after every time of sleep. He stayed hours; his
patience, his persistence were inexhaustable. We took turns
with him, each of us for an hour or two at a time. Occasionally
Dolores would try to make something clear by
thinking it. It helped. But he did not like it. It was necessary
for him virtually to go into a trance before he could receive
Dolores’ thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually Ren was talking to us, broken sentences at first,
then with a flow surprisingly voluble. He used queerly precise
phrases, occasionally a sentence inverted; and with a
strange accent of pronunciation indescribable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had tried to question him when first he could talk.
But he avoided telling us anything we wanted to know, save
that once, at Dr. Weatherby’s insistence, he assured us that
our vehicle was safe. And that the small fragment of rock
beneath the microscope—that tiny gray speck which held our
universes, our earth—was under guard so that no harm could
come to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a city, the capital, the head city of a nation. Its
people had lived here on this globe since the dawn of their
history, ascended from the beasts which even now roamed
the air, the caves, forests, and the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ren smiled at us. “You too,” he said. “I can realize you
are of an origin the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did indeed think we were of a human type very primitive.
The men of science who had seen us coming out of
infinite smallness beneath their microscope, had remarked on
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small protuberance in the corner of our eyes, the remains
of the beasts’ third eyelid, the shape of our heads, our
almost pointed ears—I noticed that his own were very nearly
circular—our harsh voices, our thick, stocky, muscular bodies
were indications that they remarked on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We discussed it. But Jim interrupted. “How did your men
of science know that we were coming out of that piece of
gray rock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been partly by chance. The fragment of rock had
been a portion of the interior wall of a room wherein scientific
experiments were being made. Ren used our words,
“Experiments in physics and chemistry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the scientists had found himself receiving strange
thought-waves. Ren described them. They were Dolores’
thoughts. The scientist traced them with measuring instruments
to the wall of the room, but could be no more exact
than that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, later, from a tiny protuberance of the wall, a glow
was observed. It proved to be a sudden radio-activity; this
protuberance of gray stone had become radiant. Electrons
were streaming off from it. The scientists chipped it off the
huge block of stone of which it was so small a part, and put
it under a microscope. It was violently radio-active. And from
it they observed a stream of red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our Beta ray,” Dr. Weatherby exclaimed. “Our voyage,
the disturbance we set up made the substance give off its
electrons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” nodded Ren. “They think so. They examined it
beneath the lens, and after a little while they saw you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice said, “My sister was getting thoughts from here.” She
told him about the mysterious young man and girl, threatened
by some unknown danger, a strange cliff, the young
couple at bay upon a ledge, the valley beneath them filled
with a nameless horror.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Ren’s face clouded. “Yes. We have had thoughts from them.
But now the thoughts have stopped. Those two are the children
of our ruler. You would call him our king? They are
the young prince and his sister, the princess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A year ago they both disappeared. A year, that is ten
times daylight and darkness. We did not know why they
went, or where. Run away, or perhaps stolen from us, for our
king is very old and of health quite bad. Soon the prince
will be king.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they disappeared. There is a very .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a horrible
savage people in the forests beyond the great caves. You
spoke it truly, my lady Alice. They are a nameless horror;
we do not often speak of things like that. We fear our prince
and princess may be there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And here at home there is a growing trouble as well.
Our women, the young girls particularly, are very restless
and aggrieved. They do not like their lot in life. Some already
are in rebellion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the great island is a colony of virgins, where no man
may go. We thought .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we hope that perhaps the virgins
had stolen our prince and princess, to hold them as hostages
that we may be forced to yield to the virgins’ cause.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The prince and the princess stolen,” Jim exclaimed, “and
you’ve done nothing about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ren smiled gently. “We have done a great deal, but to
no purpose has it been as yet. We got the prince’s thoughts.
He was asking us for help. But he would not say what
threatened, and he could not say where he was, for he did
not know. And then the thoughts suddenly stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, we have searched. The island of the virgins was
invaded. But the virgins—indeed no woman of our nation—will
admit knowing anything of our prince. We have organized
an army. All the nearer forests have been searched.
And now we are getting ready to invade the caves. But it is
not easy to get men for our army. That nameless horror—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice held an intonation almost gruesome. He changed
the subject abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our king, very shortly now he will want to see you. He
feels, perhaps, you can aid us. You men, of strength, and
these two young women—they might perhaps be of assistance
in dealing with our virgins. But you will have to be examined,
your minds gauged, so we may know if your oath of
allegiance is honorable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the infernal, mine will be!” Jim exclaimed. “I’ll go with
your army to the caves, nameless horror, or not.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Jim, with Ren, later joined me. And then Dr. Weatherby
approached. “Where are the girls?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were in another part of the building. I noticed Dr.
Weatherby gazing downstairs with a furtive air, as though
he had come here to join us, knowing the girls were not here,
and not wanting them around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim was saying, “You think, Ren, that tomorrow—I mean
after our next sleep—that the king will want to see us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Ren. “Perhaps tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When we’ve taken the oath,” Jim added, “they’ll let us
out of here, won’t they. If we’re going to join your army.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby sat down among us. He said to Ren, “You
spoke of your king being in ill-health. Do you have much
sickness, much disease, here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied the old man. “Our climate is healthy. Our
people have always been so. There is very little—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps you have doctors, men of medicine,
who are quite skillful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. There are such. In the past they have been very
learned. The records of our history—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And surgeons, perhaps, very skillful surgeons?” Dr. Weatherby
was leaning forward; his hands, locked in his lap,
were trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ren said abruptly, “What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my granddaughter, Dolores, she is blind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man nodded gravely. “That is so. It is very sorrowful.
I have seen others here. It is a terrible affliction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your surgeons, Ren. I have dared hope that she
might be cured.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment of breathless silence. A pity for
Dr. Weatherby swept me. Ren would shake his head: he
would say, “No, she cannot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he said, “Why, it could of course be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is the question of an eye available.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean you wonder about a transfer. It is strange, but
even though we are so different,” Ren said, “our eyes are
identical in structure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby went into further details concerning the
complications of Dolores’ blindness, but Ren shrugged away
its import. “It can be done,” he repeated. “And there is a man
who will give us the missing link. Loro, a criminal who must
die. He is repentant now. At his trials he pleaded that he
might live long enough to expiate his crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Loro will volunteer. I know it.”</p>

<div><h1>VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE SACRIFICE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure she will see when they take the bandages off?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think she will, Alice. They say she will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we don’t know. I wish she’d awaken. We can take the
bandage off then, can’t we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Dr. Weatherby will do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice tip-toed across the room and back. “She’s still asleep.
I wish she’d awaken. Will it have to be as dim as this in
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think so. Dimmer, maybe. They’re afraid of the
first light for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intricate, deeply involved operation had evidently
created a widespread interest throughout the city. Surgeons
had come, examined Dolores, held innumerable conferences,
examined Loro, whose eyes, as they had suspected, could
be used with perfect satisfaction. They anticipated there
would be no difficulties. This was their decision after their
final conference: they were capable of giving sight to Dolores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had not yet been out for our audience with the king.
Nothing more had been said concerning it; the operation
had become all-absorbing to everyone. The city quite obviously
was in an excitement over it, an excitement only
surpassed by our own publicly unexplained presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had taken little Dolores up to our roof-top, where,
from below, a curious throng gazed up at her. And then
taken Loro. I heard the wild cheering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had wondered why they would not take one eye only,
that each might see. But they had told me that it was impossible.
In this instance, a lone one transplanted could not
survive. There were technical, deeply medical reasons for
this. I did not pry into these.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they brought Dolores back. Her eyes were bandaged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hours passed. The healing fluid they said was very swift.
When Dolores awoke we could remove the bandages. Alice
and I sat together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Weatherby entered with Jim. Behind them, lingering
near the doorway, was the chief surgeon who had performed
the operation. He said softly, “You can awaken her. A little
less light. Then you can take the bandages off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We awakened her gently. She sat up weakly, in bewilderment.
“Oh, the bandage, yes, I remember now. They
told me it was over. I was all right. And then I went to sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We gathered around her. A flat gray twilight was in the
room. Dolores sat in the bed. Her long, dark tresses fell forward
over her white shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My breath came fast. To see the light, form, color, the
world, for the first time!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very slowly, gently, Dr. Weatherby unwound the bandages.
They dropped from his trembling hands to the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Dolores, open your eyes, just a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dark lashes on her cheeks fluttered up, and closed instantly
against the light. She could see!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes opened again, timidly, fearfully. But they stayed
open, glorious dark eyes, luminous, eyes that were seeing!
Eyes with light in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They opened very wide. Surprised, wondering!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see! I see!” There were no words to express her emotion.
Just surprise and awe surging in her voice, stamped on her
face. “I see! Jim, is that you, Jim? Why, that’s Jim I see!” Her
hand went to her eyes as though to clear a blurring vision.
“That .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. must be Jim. Come here, Jim. I want to see you
closer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fell on his knees beside the bed, and her hands went
to his shoulders, his face, his hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim, it <span class='it'>is</span> you! It looks like you!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“When do you suppose this king will see us, Len?” Jim
asked. “How is Loro?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you weren’t here when Ren told us. More to it than
he said, of course but that’s none of our business and we’re
not going to make it our business. It was the end for Loro. It
must have been planned that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I surmised as much. It’s pretty tough. At least he carried
out his last wish and was able to make atonement for his
crime by giving Dolores her sight. Now to our problem: I
wish the king would see us. What did Ren say about that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I understood that our audience would be at any time. Ren
was to let us know. Dolores had again fallen asleep. From
where Jim and I sat I could see her bed, with Dr. Weatherby
sitting there beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim said, “When we once see the king and get out of here,
things will look different. Why’s the old doc sitting there so
long? He acted queer to me, Len. Did you see his face when
he knew that Dolores was cured?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I never answered the question. We heard a sound from in
there, a choking cry, and saw Dr. Weatherby with a hand
clutching his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Len, what the infernal—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We rushed in. Dr. Weatherby sat looking at us. He had
torn the collar of his robe with convulsive fingers. He stared
at us. His hands were groping for the sides of his chair.
“Len! I can’t .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can’t get up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before we could reach him, his great head sagged to the
high hunched shoulders. He twitched a little, then slumped
inert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I swung on Jim. “Go pound on the door! Tell them to let
you out! Get Ren! Tell Ren to bring a doctor, someone to
help us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! Unconscious. He may be dying. Get help.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>They believed that Dr. Weatherby was dying. He lay in a
room off our main apartment now, still unconscious, lying
with closed eyes, motionless save for the tiny stirring of his
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, by earthly standards of day and night, now late
afternoon, a soft, pale daylight. After another time of sleep
the long night would be upon us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They could not say how long Dr. Weatherby would live.
There seemed nothing to do for him. The shock of his joy over
Dolores, the let-down of the tension under which he had
been laboring, had brought a collapse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In hushed tones, with the awe of death upon us, we sat
talking. We were on the upper half-story of the apartment off
which the small bedrooms opened. I heard the sound of the
door downstairs, and heard Ren’s voice. “How is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I leaned over the balcony. “There is no change. Come up,
Ren.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He mounted the incline stairs. With him was a young girl.
He introduced her gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The daughter of my uncle, who now is dead. She is
named Sonya; she is very proud that she has learned from
me your language. Hold out your hand, child. They shake it
for the greeting, you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I took the girl’s extended hand. She was the first woman
we had seen of this new realm, and I regarded her curiously.
She seemed of an age before full maturity, a small girl, small
as Dolores, slim, almost fragile of body, garbed in a single
short garment from neck to knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a sort of smock, of soft dull-red pleats, gathered
with a girdle at the waist, high at the neck, with long, tight-fitting
sleeves to the wrist. Over it was a long cloak of a
heavier material which she discarded upon entering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her legs were bare. On her feet were leather sandals. Her
hair was long and black as jet. Parted in the middle, it
partially covered her ears, was caught by a thong at the back
of her neck; and its long tresses, hanging nearly to her waist,
were bound by a ribbonlike cord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face was oval with expressive dark eyes and long
black lashes. Sensuous lips, I thought, but a mouth and chin
that bespoke a firm character. A beautiful young girl, intelligent,
perhaps beyond most of her race. And that she was
modish was plain to be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her coat had a jaunty cut to it, a lining of delicate fabric
and contrasting color. Her smock was very tight at the throat,
shoulders and sleeves, and tight across the bust to mould her
youthful breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It fell not quite to her knees and flared with a stiffly circular
bottom. Her face carried the stamp of youth and
health.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She discarded her cloak and stopped to remove the skin
sandals from her feet. Upon her left leg, just above the knee,
was clasped a broad, white metal band.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad to know the strangers.” Her glance went to the
room where Dr. Weatherby was lying. “But I intrude at a
very sad time for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She and Ren sat quietly down among us. Ren said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our king, too, is ill. A very old man.” He shook his head
dubiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Jim. “Well, then we—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya seemed to take the thought from him. “I have already
told my cousin,” she said quickly, “that you must
swear your allegiance to the king at once. We need you.
You men look very strong, very masterful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said it frankly, merely as a statement of fact, but
there was an unconscious admiration in her gaze. “We need
you and we .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps we need the girls.” She said the
last with a singular, enigmatic emphasis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right,” said Jim heartily. “You fix it up for us, get the
audience. I want to be out of here. We’ve been tied here like
time-keepers in a tower.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our king will die. That is sure now. Our girls must act;
it is now or never!”</p>

<div><h1>VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>REBELLING VIRGINS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was from Sonya that we first learned any tangible details
of this new realm. She and I, with Dolores and Alice, were
seated by Dr. Weatherby’s bedside. Two days had passed.
His condition was unchanged. We were sure now that he
would never regain consciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old king too, was more gravely ill than before. He had
sent for us so that at his bedside we might take the oath of
service. Jim had gone with Ren. The rest of us remained beside
the dying doctor. The end would come soon, at any time
now, doubtless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya was talking softly. I turned from the bedside to
regard her earnest face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This city,” she was saying, “we call Kalima. There was an
ancient tribe dwelt here; the chief, they thought he was a
god, the god Kali.” She was addressing Alice, but now she
turned to me. “Our land lies in a great depression of this
globe’s surface. Once, perhaps, it was the bottom of some
great sea. It rises into mountains everywhere. It is not large;
we are less than a quarter of a million people. The caves
are at the foothills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will hear more of them later.” She had waved aside
a question of Dolores’. “On the Great Island, not far from
here, is what we call the Village of the Virgins, where now
about three hundred of our girls are living in rebellion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rebellion against the government?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Against the man-made laws.” She smiled her quiet,
grave smile. “You have come, you strangers, at a time to find
our nation in what we girls think is a condition very grave.
You, my friends, will understand very well what we girls are
protesting against. And now, with our prince and princess
vanished, and our king about to die, the time has come to—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She checked herself suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice was regarding her with a blue-eyed gaze of quite obvious
admiration. Dolores moved over on the low couch; her
hand plucked at the hem of Sonya’s smock as it lay just above
her knees and touched the smooth white metal band that
encircled her leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya, what is that? Just for ornament? It’s very pretty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said. “Not altogether for ornament. Every woman
wears one.” She brushed her fingers across it; her smile was
quizzical. “It is, in fact, well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it had become almost a
symbol of what we girls are striving for. The virgins’ band.
You see, it is quite unmarked. No man’s name is engraved
there. I’ll explain in a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our king, with twenty of his counsellors—my cousin Ren
is one of them—rule the nation. They make no new laws. The
old laws are good enough for them. The guards, you would
call them police, are all the army we have.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are all men, young, sturdy fellows who have no
thought but to do what they are told. Which is right, of
course. It is the laws which are wrong, inhuman. They are
very old laws. They have now become customs, traditions,
handed down from father to son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her tone was suddenly bitter. She gestured with a slim,
expressive hand. “I must talk more calmly. These things
against which we have now come to open rebellion, were
doubtless necessary at the beginning. The laws were made by
men who knew no better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The difficulty is in the sex of our children. Out of three
births, two on the average are females and only one a male.
We have, therefore, twice as many females as males—twice
as many women as men. Or at least, there would be twice as
many if—” She checked herself again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus we have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think Ren said that on earth it was
termed polygamy. A man may marry more than one woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolores said impulsively, “Oh, I would not like that! It
used to be a custom in many parts of the earth, but there is
almost none of it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We girls of this generation do not like it either,” said
Sonya.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice turned very grave. “What we are rebelling
against is far worse. Often our girl children, if they seem not
destined to be beautiful, are killed. The father does not wish
the expense of too many girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls or women are never allowed to work. They must
only strive to be beautiful. And when they have at last
reached the proper age, to get rid of them by marriage, the
father must pay a large tax to the state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the age of twenty a girl must choose one of the men
who has recorded his name as desiring her. Any man is
legally eligible to do that. He may have no wife as yet. Or
he may have one wife, or several. If he has the necessary
money for the tax, and deposits it with the government, his
name is recorded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” she was cynical now, “the government needs
the money. And it likes our girls to be beautiful. Fifty men
may record their names as desiring a girl who is very
beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She can choose but one man. But the government only
refunds half the money the others have deposited. It makes
a lot of money on a very beautiful girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sort of lottery!” I exclaimed. “With women as the
prizes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not understand,” said Sonya. “But that is the way it
is with us. Beautiful girls are profitable to the government.
No girl-child who showed promise of beauty has ever been
found murdered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But woman’s beauty fades, and there are many female
mouths to feed, and female bodies to clothe and house. It
makes more work for the men and the men do not like to
work. And so—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cynicism had left her voice. A hush fell upon her
tragic words. “And so, when a woman can no longer bear
children, when her beauty is going, then she is considered a
burden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has never been trained to work. She is useless; an
expense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Each year our old women are chosen—a certain number
of them, depending on the birth-rate—are chosen to die.
They are given a blanket, a little food, and are taken to a
place we call Death Island. Left there alone, they live a
while. Then die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve seen them draw the death number! I’ve seen, on the
island, their wasted bodies lying huddled!” Her voice choked.
“But they go away, start for the island so patient, so resigned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is that for which we are in rebellion more than anything
else! We of this generation now cannot stand it. We
will not stand it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To my mind had come memories of the savages of our
earth, not so many centuries ago. They too, had thought it
expedient to leave aged members of their tribes to die. The
vision Sonya was invoking to my imagination was horrible.
I found my voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your men here, Sonya, surely they are not all against
you girls? Your cause?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said. “But how many are with us at heart, we
do not know. And men are very strange. You cannot talk
with them; they pretend you are not intelligent enough to
be worthy of talking. My cousin Ren—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ren! It seemed incongruous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went on, “He is like all the rest. It is not, from his
viewpoint, inhuman. It is the way things always have been.
His mother died that way. He says, ‘Her life was ended.’ He
says that men, brave men, meet death that way. Their life is
over, the creator calls them and they go bravely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said Dolores, “the man who hands out the death
number is not the creator.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said Sonya, “but if you told that to a man he would
say you do not understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hand went to her leg. “You asked me about this band.
It is placed upon us when we are just maturing. On it is engraved
the name of the man we are to marry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he divorces us, that is written here, and the name of
the man who next takes us. Our marriage record: written
plain that all may see!” Her fingers touched the band’s smooth
surface. “There is nothing on mine, as yet. And there never
will be, unless we win our case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice said, “Are you one of the rebels?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am at heart, and I’m working with them. Technically,
legally I am not. It is nearly a year yet, as you on your
earth measure time, before I am of the age when I can be
forced to marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have the girls done?” I asked. “Refused to marry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. About eighteen hundred of them. Most are just about
at the legal age. They left the cities, went to the Great Island,
and there they have built themselves a village. They
grow food there; they work; they are self-supporting. To
many old women and a few girl-children, they have given
sanctuary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the government does nothing about it?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They did, at first. Men were sent to the Virgins’ Island
to get some of the old women; but the girls forcibly resisted
them. Some of the girls were killed. Nothing much has been
done about it since. The government, I think, does not know
what to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was scornful. “Our girls are very beautiful. It would
not be profitable to kill them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice said, “You reach the marriage age in a year, Sonya?
Have any men recorded their names for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes,” she said. “There were eight, I think, when I last
went to the records.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you wouldn’t marry any of them? Or perhaps I
should not ask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? There is no secret in such things. One man
whose name is recorded for me I love very dearly. Our
prince.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sound from Dolores interrupted her. Dolores was sitting
with hands to her forehead and eyes closed. She murmured,
“I caught someone’s thoughts! Now they come again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We waited through a breathless silence. Then Dolores
murmured, “The prince. You called him Altho? It is he!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya gripped her. “What is he thinking? Tell me! Tell
me quickly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she too, received the thoughts. She sat tense. “Oh,
the princess is dead! Killed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Killed!” echoed Dolores. Then her face went vague: she
was getting nothing more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But evidently Sonya was still in communication. She cried
aloud involuntarily, “Altho! Dearest, dearest Altho! Where
are you? Tell Sonya. Oh, he does not know! Or he cannot
tell me! He says—” it was a stark whisper of horror—“he
says soon he will be killed too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sprang to her feet, then abruptly sat down again.
“Altho! Altho, where are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The communication broke. Her face went vague, puzzled,
empty. And then despairing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the window, in the street below the balcony, a
sudden murmur of voices floated up to us. We went to the
balcony. It was night now, a night of pale stars in a cloudless
sky. Shouting people were coming up the street. They
appeared in a moment at the bottom of the hill, a crowd of
men, a hundred or more. They came forward, swept around
the corner, and vanished. Above the babble was a single
sentence. A man called it. Others took it up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya murmured, “They say, ‘Our king is dying.’ And
the princess dead! And your grandfather.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Death everywhere!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man in the street shouted again. And Sonya sprang
from the couch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says, ‘Our king is dead.’ ” She laughed hysterically.
“Death everywhere! I must go to the Island of the Virgins.
Will you come? I can take you. The virgins are ready! We
must act at once!”</p>

<div><h1>IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE NAMELESS HORROR</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time we had had any freedom since our
arrival. Ren had not returned with Jim. If the king were
really dead, there would be a great confusion at the castle.
They might be detained indefinitely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya would not wait. “A few hours only,” she urged.
“Then we will be back. I will leave a message for my cousin
and your friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first shock of Dr. Weatherby’s death was over. There
was no advantage in the girls remaining here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We started finally. On the lower floor of the house we
found long dark cloaks and donned them, with a queerly
flat, mound-shaped hat for me and light scarfs to cover the
girls’ heads. The lower door was open. Ren had left it so,
knowing that Sonya would stay with us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Technically we were prisoners. But Sonya paid scant ceremony
to that now. The king was dead: our oath of allegiance
to the nation would be taken for granted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My allegiance goes to you,” Dolores said naively. “You
girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Sonya. “But do not say so openly. And you, my
friend, Leonard—you are a man—be careful what you say if
you have any sympathy for our cause.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sympathy! How mild a word, as again visions of what
she had told us sprang before me!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this residential section of the city there was at this hour
no traffic in the street. The shouting crowd had disappeared.
Sonya led us to the main street level. The pedestrian bridges
were above us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An unnatural silence seemed to hang about the dark, somnolent
city, as though it only seemed sleeping and was wide
awake. A tenseness was in the air. The houses were dark,
but in almost every window I fancied that figures were
watching, faces peering out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We avoided the lights. Mounted the hill for a block or two,
then turned into a very narrow street of shadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The houses here, the back of houses, I assumed, were
blank, two-storied walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We passed each of them hurriedly. My heart was thumping.
Sonya had said that these were merely back entrances to
inner courtyards of the houses. But it seemed, to my
sharpened fancy, that in every one some horrible lurking
thing was waiting to spring upon us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya was leading. She was taking us through a back way
to her home, to get the vehicle that would transport us to
the island. We were nearing the end of the alley; it opened
ahead of us into a broad street with a dim glow of light
illumining it. To our right, just ahead, was a courtyard entrance:
a yawning cave-mouth of emptiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had almost reached it when Sonya abruptly halted,
checked our advance as though she had struck some invisible
barrier, stopped, and shrank backward, pressing against
us. And her hand in terror was over her mouth to stifle a
scream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw it then, what she was seeing. A thing, something
monstrous, lurking in the blackness of that cave-like house
entrance, a thing huge, of vague, grotesque outline, an upright
thing, with a great balloon-like head, bobbing from
side to side, two eyes glowing in the darkness. And below
them, where a neck might have been, two other smaller eyes,
green, blazing points of fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all my veins the blood seemed freezing, prickling needle-points
of ice exuding through my pores, my scalp prickling
at the hair-roots. I was stricken with fright and horror. But
an instinct, so that I scarcely realized what I was doing,
made me pull Sonya soundlessly backward, sweep all three
of the girls behind me and downward. And as they sank to
the pavement, I crouched tense in front of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thing seemingly had not heard us, or seen us. It advanced
out of the darkness of the doorway; in the dimness of
the outside light I saw it more clearly, a thing like a great
upright animal, ten feet tall, perhaps, and monstrously cast in
human mold, with thick, bent legs. It had a long, thick
trunk with wide, powerful shoulders and a deep, bulging
chest, and arms that dangled nearly to its knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Its head, no wider than its powerful neck, was small,
round, and flat on top. There seemed a face; its tiny blazing
eyes were plain in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A two-headed thing! The small head was bent forward.
Behind it, as though astride of the shoulders, was another
head, balloon-like: huge, wider than the shoulders, a head
seemingly inflated, distended. A large flat face. The thing took
a step. Its large head wobbled as it moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My hand behind me kept the girls motionless. The thing
came to the end of the narrow street, emerged into the glow
of light there. It did not pause—the light obviously was not
to its liking—it bounded sidewise, noiseless on padded feet,
and was gone into the shadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in that instant under the light, I had seen it more
clearly. A giant, gorilla-like figure. A man! Black hair seemed
upon its body, but the body was partially clothed. And I
fancied I had seen a belt strapped about its waist, with
dangling weapons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bobbling head astride upon its shoulders was very
different from the rest of the thing. A bloated membrane? I
got that impression. It seemed a smooth, dead-white skin;
I thought I had seen distended veins on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as the powerful body leaped, I fancied I saw thin
little arms, four of them, hanging inert from the bloated head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was gone. I breathed again. Behind me the huddled
girls were shuddering. At my ear Sonya was whispering,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Nameless Horror!”</p>

<div><h1>X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE FLIGHT TO THE VIRGINS’ ISLAND</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>We did not continue down that street. Sonya took us back.
We turned another corner, and another. Soon we were near
her home. She had not swerved from her purpose to take
us to the Virgins’ Island. This thing we had seen was one of
many of its kind which dwelt in the fastnesses of the mountains
beyond the caves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They never came out into the light; none, Sonya thought,
had ever been seen more clearly than we had seen this one.
No man of this realm, to Sonya’s knowledge, had ever ventured
into the caves to seek them out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not understand such a condition. On earth, nothing
had ever been so fearsome but that man had sought to
destroy it. But these people were of a different cast of mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya,” I demanded, “how long have these things been in
the caves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were first seen only just before our prince and princess
vanished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We reached Sonya’s home, a low, oval stone building,
dark in its enshrouding garden of flower-trees. She led us
aside, toward a small outbuilding. I suddenly paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was in sympathy with Sonya and her cause, but was not
the plight of the prince more important? Had I not better go
and join Jim now, and follow the course we had planned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We reached the dark, single-storied outbuilding. Sonya
touched a switch. A soft glow showed inside. It was a
square building of stone and metal, windows barred by a
metal screening, a doorway with a hinged screen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya,” I said, “just what is this you intend doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She regarded me. Alice and Dolores stood beside her. I
found myself arrayed against the three of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” she said, “we are going to the Island of the Virgins.
The girls are ready; we have been waiting—” she hesitated,
then finished, “waiting for this chance which has come tonight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What chance? The king being ill or dead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes flashed. “Yes. The girls are ready. They will come
back with us, now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood with shoulders squared, a defiant little figure
before me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said, more gently, “What are you girls planning to do,
Sonya?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think she had already told Alice and Dolores. They moved
closer as though to defend her. Alice flashed me a defiant
look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I repeated, “What are you planning to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes held level. “It is not my secret. You are a man.
I have no right to tell you.” She added very slowly, but
wholly without emotion,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think perhaps you had better go back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It struck me with a vague sense of shame. I felt like a
deserter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice said calmly, “Are you going back, Len?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With what loyalty these girls already were banded against
me! Little Dolores clutched me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t do that, Leonard! Sonya, you misunderstand him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I tried to explain myself. “It’s only because I thought
the other course would be better for the prince,” I finished.
“How long will this take us, Sonya?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sudden tears were in her eyes. “I believe you! But you
must know that I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. least of all, would delay to help
him I love! Mine is the better way, and we won’t be long—a
few hours at most.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I yielded, “All right, Sonya. You know best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We entered the building, a large room divided by the
metal screening into huge cages. A great commotion, the
flapping of wings, greeted our entrance. Travel in this realm
indeed was primitive. We were to go by air, on a gliding
platform drawn by giant birds trained to harness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya pulled down a swinging tube of light from the ceiling
and held it toward one of the cages. Eight giant birds were
there, soft, gray-white feathered bodies, heads small, round
and bald with black top-knots like plumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood upon short legs, yet were as tall as myself.
They seemed very gentle; they regarded us timorously, but
curiously. They knew Sonya; as she entered the cage, they
nuzzled with their beaks against her smock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Nana! They want sweets,” she laughed. One, more
bold, pecked at her pocket. She leaned, and with her shoulder
heaved it away. Then she produced small pieces of
sweetmeat and made them each take a piece decorously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are well trained, you see?” She rested an arm against
the great curving side of one of them. I could well imagine
that on its soft back she could have ridden into the air. One
had lazily opened its wings; a feathered spread of fifteen feet
at least, graceful wings, gray-white, with tips that were
solid black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The platform was under an enclosure of the flat roof. Sonya
rolled it out, a platform some ten feet long, by six wide.
Soft furs covered its surface. It was mounted upon small
wheels, with a frame set in small cylinders of compressed gas
as cushions against the shock of landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Midway of the platform, underneath, was a cross rod.
Sonya extended its sections sidewise, each jutting out some
six feet beyond the platform edge. To each of the ends of this
rod, a bird was harnessed. The other six were in two strings
in front, three in a string, one in advance of the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were reins for the leading birds to pull their heads
gently from one side to the other, a rein to pull downward on
their feet, another rein, which when drawn upon, raised a
cushion to press upward against the bird’s throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took Sonya only a few minutes to harness them. I had
been inspecting the platform. It was built of a light metal
framework, upon which a thin, strong membrane was stretched.
The whole seemed light as a kite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath it, set in the space between its landing gear, was
a system of small, flexible wings, and movable cones through
which the air rushed. And there was a horizontal and vertical
rudder, with flexible tips. Flying skill was needed. There
were several controls near the front of the platform, where
now the reins were held in a notched cross-bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are ready,” said Sonya. She stretched upon her side
on the fur covering of the platform with the reins and the
controls before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We took our places beside her and behind her, lying at
full length, arms crooked into leather straps to hold us.
Sonya called to the birds. Eight of them as one, leaped
upward. The great wings flapped. We moved, rolled across
the roof. At its edge we lifted with a jerk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The low housetop, the dark trees, other roofs, the dim city
lights all slid downward into a blur of shadow. On a long
slant, we headed upward into the starlit night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I lay on my side, clinging to that swaying, leaping platform.
The wind surged past, tearing away every sound save
the flapping of those giant wings. A graceful bird on each
side of me, two strings of them slanting upward in front,
winged swiftly up into the night, drawing me after them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dark world was lost and gone. The star encrusted dome
of the heavens encompassed everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not an air voyage. It was flying. The platform
fluttered, slid over the air like some swiftly drawn kite. The
heavens swung with a dizzy lurching. I gazed over the edge
at the dark, moving landscape far down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The faint lights of the city showed a thinly-built, suburban
area, then the shore of a star-lit sea ahead. Primitive flying,
with the first startling strangeness of it gone, its romance
swept over me, a magic carpet upon which I lay, magically
flying over reams of mystery, a flight unreal—romantically
miraculous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was brought back from roaming fancy. Dolores, lying beside
me, was pulling at my shoulder. I caught her words
before the wind snatched at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, Leonard! There is the island!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no fear of this flight upon Dolores’s face. Only
an eager wonderment, her mind struggling with these sights:
romantic, awing to me, how much more so to her so newly
emerged from a life-long darkness! “See the island, Leonard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were, I suppose, no more than a thousand feet high.
The shore of the sea was nearly beneath us, a dark, curving
shore of gray sand with gentle white waves rolling upon it.
Beyond the shore, some ten miles out, a dark island showed.
It seemed irregularly circular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we swept closer its beach became visible, gray-white
sand with white rollers. A tangle of vegetation was behind
the beach, a forest jungle with the land sloping up over gentle
foothills to a cone-shaped hill which occupied the island’s
center.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Along one shore of the island, yellow and blue spots of
lights were showing among the trees at the edge of the beach.
It was all dim in the starlight. Far ahead, where the sea
unbroken reached the horizon of stars, a yellow glow had
come to the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya gestured, “The moon is rising.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came with a startling abruptness. A great yellow world
swung up, twice, three times the visual size of our moon: a
glowing yellow disk, marked with the dark configurations
of its mountains. It rose horn-shaped, mounted straight up,
slowly, but with a movement quite visible. The stars paled
around it. A flood of yellow light lay upon the sea in a broad
path of rippling gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The island was bathed in the golden flood. We were much
closer to it now, swooping a few hundred feet above its
beach which along here was broad and hard. The jungle was
beside us, a fairyland of tropical verdure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Warmed by the waters of the sea, and perhaps by hidden
fires of the cone-shaped hill, the vegetation grew to giant
size.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A giant forest edged with gold, mysteriously dark, romantic,
amorous, scented with spices and the heavy perfume
of flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We landed upon the beach where the warm waves were
liquid gold beside low, primitive, palm-thatched dwellings
set like ground nests in the verdure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the rush of our flight gone, I felt a new warmth in
the air. Upon my cheeks was the caressing breath of a warm
breeze from the sea; it stirred the palm-fronds to amorous
whispering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>White figures were drawn back from the beach to watch
us land. They crowded forward into the moonlight, young
girls, slim and white, with long, flowing black hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I stood up and stepped from the platform to the sand,
some of them scattered and fled with startled feminine cries
into the enshrouded foliage. Others came shyly forward,
crowded around us—golden nymphs in the moonlight, with
a brief, veil-like garment from shoulder to thigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were surprised at me, a man, here upon their island.
They crowded around Sonya, talking seemingly all at once,
casting mistrustful glances at me, and glances of curiosity
and friendliness at Alice and Dolores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What Sonya said to them I could only guess. It caused an
excitement; like fauns, many of them leaped away, running
down the beach, scattering over the village. In the distance
I could hear their cries, and other cries, shouts, a great
activity beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And presently there was heard the cheep of giant birds,
the flapping of their wings as they were released from their
cages and brought out to be harnessed. Far ahead down
the beach in the moonlight, presently a crowd of the girls
began rolling out a huge platform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The few girls who remained with Sonya continued talking.
They were tense now, but wholly composed, beautiful, intelligent-looking
girls, most of them a year or so older than
Sonya, and very much the same type. Upon the left leg of
each, just above the knee, was a broad metal band.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls now were ignoring me. But Sonya called Dolores
and Alice over, and it was obvious they were welcomed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw presently, some of the older women. With a few
little girls among them, they came to the edge of the forest
and stood timidly regarding us—infancy and age, common
fugitives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice was gesturing toward the sky. I turned. Off there in
the starlight, in the direction we had come, was a lone bird
flying. In a moment I could see its wings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya called something; and added to Alice, “A girl arriving
from Kalima.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bird swooped in a great descending arc, a great white
bird like those which had drawn our platform. Mounted upon
its back was the figure of a girl, her arms clinging about its
neck. It soared with poised wings, descended to the beach
near us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl leaped to the sand and called, “Sonya! Sonya!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked in their own language; then Sonya whirled to
me. Her face had gone white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alta, this girl, lives very near Ren’s house in Kalima. I
do not mean my home, his and mine. I mean that other house
of his where you were living. Alta went there to see me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was talking swiftly. Alice and Dolores drew me to one
side; a common feeling of disaster was upon us all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alta found the door open and went in. She read my message
to Ren, that we had come here to the island. She was
leaving. In the street outside she heard voices. From the
window she saw Ren with your Jim. They were nearly to the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a great black thing leaped upon them, a giant,
with a great, wobbling head. What we saw, Leonard! The
Nameless Horror! It leaped upon them, and there were two or
three others of its kind. They seized my cousin and Jim.
Lifted them up, carried them off! She .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Alta, took one of
my birds, and came here to tell us!”</p>

<div><h1>XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A MAN, TO PLAY A MAN’S PART</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I stood a moment, transfixed with horror. Alice’s face had
become as white as Sonya’s. Dolores uttered a faint little
cry, “Jim!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya—” I began. But she had turned to give orders to
the girls. They sped away. I finished, “Sonya, get me back,
at once!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she agreed. “But you can do nothing—a stranger—you
cannot talk our language.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can, with you to interpret for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She whirled upon Alta with other questions, then back to
me. “More than ever now, I must go through with our plans.
Alta says the king is not dead. But dying, he will die at any
moment. We must get back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down the beach the large platform was ready. A hundred
girls or more were loading upon it. With a great flapping of
the wings of the birds, it moved down the beach. Rose into
the air. It had four strings of ten birds each, with others
harnessed in tandem all along its sides. Magnificently, it
sailed upward, turned in a broad arc, and passed us high
overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From everywhere now the girls were rising. Another great
platform, and still another. A score of smaller ones; and from
the forest, a hundred or more individual birds, each with a
lone rider.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They flapped up from among the palms; circled overhead,
with their numbers augmenting until they headed away. The
first platforms were now mere blobs in the starlight. A thousand
girls, I estimated, were up there in flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We hurried to our platform. Again we were in the air.
Below us still another platform was rising; around us, three
or four mounted birds circled like a convoy. We took our
place in the line and sped back to the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the king dead, Sonya?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I do not think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I waited a moment. “Sonya, you girls are not armed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said impulsively, “No. But in the underground rooms
of the castle, the science weapons are stored. Once we get
control of them—” She checked herself, but she had told
me what I wanted to know. An arsenal under the castle! The
weapons of a half-forgotten science of this decadent race,
stored there!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shuddered at the visions which surged to my imagination.
Here in the city—a government menaced by crusading
girls! This was our condition, pitiable indeed, to oppose a
savage, outside enemy!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet what was I to do? I pondered it until a vague possibility
came to me. It gripped me. It seemed feasible. I believed
I could accomplish it. With swiftness of action, power,
dominance, I could carry it through. A grim exaltation was
upon me. A man, to play a man’s part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We landed with a swoop upon the moonlit garden sward.
The girls crowded around us, with a fringe of curious,
apathetic men behind them. Sonya turned to speak to Alice
and Dolores. Near by was a dark path between beds of giant
flowers. I slipped from the platform. With my cloak held
before my face, I avoided the girls and plunged into the
shadows of the flowered path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The path was dark, cut off from the moonlight by a great
bed of flowers rising high above my head. A group of men
came toward me; I stepped between the flower stalks, stood
enshrouded in my cloak, my figure merging with the shadows,
until the men had passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I caught a near glimpse of them. Young men, stalwart
fellows, no doubt, according to the standards of their race.
But not one of them was taller than my shoulder, and beside
me, they were frail, delicate of build.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a weaponless fight, I could doubtless have engaged
two or three of them, and come off the victor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The path turned into a dim street that encircled the rear
of the castle, into the arsenal through some postern gate
along here. The arsenal was within this curving wall of stone.
I passed such a gate now, a small narrow opening, half the
height of my upright body. But it was blocked solidly with
a metal door which I could see no way of opening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I passed on, heading back through the city to the house in
which we had been held since our arrival. Behind that house,
with a viaduct connecting them, was the laboratory room in
which we had arrived. Our space-vehicle was there. I could
not operate the vehicle, but it held a weapon I wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remembered that Jim had brought it. In the excitement
of our arrival, the strangeness of everything, we had forgotten
it, the Frazier beam, brought out by an Aberdeen physicist
in 1994.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had left the castle behind me, and turned, somewhat
dubiously, into another street. I was sure if I could get to
Sonya’s house, where so recently we had been, I could retrace
my way from there. I had planned this while on the
flying platform as we circled over the castle. I had been able
then to locate Sonya’s home, and to gauge the lay of the
streets in between. I turned another corner. The street was
brighter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another corner. I saw and recognized Sonya’s house. From
there, my way was sure. Within twenty minutes after leaving
the castle grounds, I was groping in the darkness back
of the house where Dr. Weatherby’s body lay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was near here that the Nameless Horrors had caught
Jim and Ren. But I saw no signs of them now. The viaduct
connecting the two buildings was a dark thin line against
the stars. The building I was hoping to enter was wholly
dark. A two-story structure: the viaduct extended from its
upper floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I prowled around. The lower window openings were all
barred. The door oval was barred. A stairway led up from
the ground to the viaduct. From the viaduct’s platform I saw
a cornice, too high for a normal man to reach. But I leaped
for it, pulled myself up upon the dome-shaped roof of a turret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A leap from here and I was upon the main flat roof. There
should be a door under a mound cover; most of the buildings
had them. I located it, wrenched at its bar. It yielded. I
went down a curving metal ladder, into the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment I had located the laboratory room. Our
vehicle in its full normal size lay here, dead white, an end of
it tinged yellow by a shaft of moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stepped within it, went to Jim’s cupboard, lighting a tiny
battery light overhead. The Frazier weapon I sought was
here. Its <span class='it'>copite</span> cone, with smooth glistening bone handle,
<span class='it'>copite</span> headband, the tiny pulse motor, the wires; it was all
complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A triumph swept me. I was unarmed no longer. Playing a
lone hand, here in this strange world, a man, comparatively of
giant strength and physical power. But I was more than that
now. I had a mental weapon, and the mental strength to use
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not stop to adjust the apparatus. I wound it up in its
wire, and hastily retreated. I reached the street, with the
weapon under my cloak. I hurried back to the castle over
the same route; I did not want to chance losing my way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as I advanced, I had more than memory of the streets
to guide me. From the direction of the castle, a blur of cries
was audible, a hum, a murmur, which as I progressed resolved
itself into shouts. The shouting of a mob: heavy,
angry voices of men, shrill cries of girls, a single, long, agonized
scream of a girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was on a lower street that fronted the water. A side
entrance to the castle grounds was before me. Through the
trees I could see the frowning turreted walls of the castle. I
stopped to adjust my weapon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took no more than a moment. Around my forehead,
with hat discarded, I bound the headband, a narrow strip
of finely woven <span class='it'>copite</span> wire, with two small electrodes pressing
my temples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the right side two finely drawn silk-insulated wires
dangled from the headband to my neck. I tucked them under
my shirt, over my shoulder, down my right arm to my wrist.
A band at my wrist, to which the wires were attached, held
the tiny pulse-motor in place. My heart set it in motion, to
generate the necessary current.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frazier projector was a <span class='it'>copite</span> cone, this one some ten
inches long; its shape was a cone section, one end, the
muzzle, with an open diameter of six inches, the other end,
one-fifth inch, across which the diaphragm was fitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bone handle screwed into place at the diaphragm. It
was hollow. Within it were amplifying tubes and a transformer,
miracles of smallness. The whole projector weighed
some twenty Troy ounces. I plugged the two connecting wires
from my wristband to its butt, gripped the handle with my
index finger along its side, resting on the trigger button.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was ready! My heart was racing. The tiny motor at my
wrist was racing. I could feel the hum of the current, the
prickling of it under the forehead band, its tiny stabbing
throb at the electrodes pressing my temples. There was power
within me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had flung off my cloak. I stood in the white silk shirt,
dark, short, tight trousers, and high, heavy black stockings of
my earth costume, stood with outflung arms for an instant
and exulted in the wave of triumph which swept me. Against
the people the power of my weapon would be invincible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furtive no longer, I advanced with bold, open strides to
the gate of the castle grounds. A few men were there, evidently
about to enter. They stared at me. Before the strangeness
of my aspect, the boldness of my flashing glance, they
quailed, cried with fear and scattered before me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not heed them. Beyond the gate, back from the
water there was a rise of ground. I mounted it, and from the
thicket of flowers that ornamented its top, gazed out at the
moonlit scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between the mound on which I stood, and the foot of the
broad staircase leading up the broad terrace to the castle
entrance, a throng of men were standing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spectators, standing idle. Occasionally a group of them
would surge forward in one direction or the other, milling
about some individual who seemed abruptly determined upon
a course of action. A mob without a leader. Excited, aimless,
striving for points of vantage to see what was taking
place in front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls were massed at the foot of the castle steps.
Evidently, just before I arrived, the girls had tried to mount
them. The guards were gathered in a group on top. Half
way down, a girl’s body was lying. It writhed, rolled down
the steps. From the crowd of men a murmur rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene was clear in the yellow moon-glow. The throng
of girls at the staircase bottom, were gathering their leaders,
preparing again to mount. The tense guards on top seemed
confused, not knowing how to deal with this unarmed attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the castle balcony, at the head of the steep metal stairway,
a few other guards were standing. And on the rooftop,
I could make out the doddering figures of old men, gazing
down in confused terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was, momentarily, a pause over the scene: a silence,
expectant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But abruptly the hush was broken by a shrill, electrical
whine. It rose in pitch to a scream, a siren from the castle
battlements. It screamed for a moment, then abruptly was
stilled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wondered what it meant. The crowd was stricken breathless.
But for an instant only. Then it broke into a roar of
shouting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king had died!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not know it at the time, but I suspected it. On the
rooftop, the old men were waving their arms; one of them
seemed trying to talk to the throng. But his voice was lost in
the din.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As though the siren had been a signal, the girls began
swarming up the staircase, unarmed girls—unarmed save for
the shining armor of their virginity and the desperation of
their purpose. I stood watching; it was necessary for me to
know with what arms the guards were equipped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some fifty young men, they stood in a group at the head
of the staircase. The girls came up in a throng. I saw then
that each of the guards seemed armed only with a long,
curved knife, like a scimitar, incased in a black metal sheath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some drew these knives, waved the naked blades. But the
girls were beyond intimidation. They came surging—a hundred
of them in the first rank, with other hundreds pressing
from below. The guards met them halfway down, a confusion
of white figures with the black forms of the guards
struggling in their midst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man with twenty girls around him. He did not want to
use his naked sword. It was torn from him, the girls tearing
at him savagely. He went down; the white forms swept over
him. A girl who had secured his sword waved it with shrill
cries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another guard, more desperate, was using his sheathed
weapon as a club. He had cleared a space around him. A girl
leaped; the club struck her head. She fell limp. But he too,
was soon overwhelmed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls presently were near the staircase top; the guards
remaining there were standing now, all with naked swords. I
could not doubt but that they would be driven to use
them. The girls momentarily had paused, a dozen steps below
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many now were armed with swords they had taken. The
blades were waving. A score of girls with the swords, pushed
their way to the upper rank, gathered for concerted, frenzied
action. Then, with a rush, started up the empty intervening
steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had been standing on that hillock, enshrouded by the
flowers. I had wanted to be sure beyond a doubt, how the
guards were armed, and had hoped vainly that I might
locate Sonya. And a fear had struck me for Alice and Dolores.
Where were they in all this turmoil?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought I saw Sonya now, her white-limbed figure, with
the dark, high-necked smock. She was creeping alone up the
steep bank of the terrace beside the staircase, trying, no
doubt, to attain the top unnoticed, and thus to surprise the
guards from behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My time had come. I stepped from the shadows of the
flowers into a broad patch of moonlight. From the hillock
here, I knew my figure would be visible from all parts of
the scene. I stood, drawn to full height, with arms outstretched.
And called with all my voice,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya! Sonya!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fighting did not stop, but the nearer men of the crowd
turned and saw me. A murmur went up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya! Sonya! Sonya!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I kept repeating it. The murmur spread; rose to a shouting,
shouts of wonderment, awe, and then fear. I strove to
hold my voice to dominate the noise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya! Sonya! Sonya!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The faces were turning my way. The shouting near me died
into a frightened silence. The men were milling about, with a
surge away from me. Over on the stairs I saw that the girls
had paused in their attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya! Sonya! Sonya!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had turned, was staring at me. I waved my arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya! I am Leonard; come here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I plunged forward down the hillock path. The crowd
scattered before me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya, come here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had turned. She was coming! I advanced steadily, not
running, walking swiftly, with arms outstretched, menacing
the crowd with my unknown weapon. The throng was stricken
motionless with the strangeness of my aspect. From the
staircase, the girls were staring; the guards were staring, a
sea of faces, everywhere staring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Calmly I advanced, and before me now a lane opened in
the crowd. For all my outward calmness, my heart was pounding.
The pulse-motor at my wrist was throbbing. I had not
used my weapon yet. But it would be effective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya! Come here! Hurry! Sonya!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My words, strange of language, awed the crowd further.
The men parted before Sonya’s running figure. She came up
panting, white-faced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Len!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya, you are going to obey me! You understand? You .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
everyone—obey me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared. I was speaking swiftly, grimly, imperatively.
“You stay at my side. I’ll want you to translate when I give
orders. Was that siren to announce the king’s death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Leonard, what are you doing? That thing in
your hand—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I silenced her. And then, fearing perhaps that she might not
follow me, I gripped her hand, jerked her forward as I ran
with rapid strides toward the crowd of girls at the foot of the
stairway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think that Sonya believed at that moment that I had lost
my reason. Her face stared up at me with terror in her
eyes—a frightened child beside my bulk, whom I was dragging
forward so swiftly that she could hardly keep her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few men near us shouted at me, but when I turned
ferociously on them, they ran. Someone threw a missile at me,
then another—stones which they were picking up from the
flower beds. One struck my back; and one struck Sonya.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd was beginning to take courage; a wave of it
surged at me. Struggling men shoving one another, shouted
menacingly at me; but the men in the front rank, shoved
forward by the press behind them, were pushing back,
away from me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another stone hit me. I stopped short. I did not want to
use the Frazier beam yet—time enough for that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya, tell them to stop!” I dropped her hand, stood
away from her. “Tell them that I won’t hurt you! Tell them
to stop .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or I’ll kill them! All of them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The missiles stopped at the first sound of her voice. From
the stairway top a guard was shouting up to one of the old
men on the roof; at Sonya’s voice they both were silent
to listen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I added swiftly, “Sonya, you follow me! I don’t want to
drag you! Will you come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ll come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I took her at her word and ran on. I had overawed an
unarmed crowd of spectators. But the girls were still ahead
of me, a thousand or more of them, jammed near the foot of
the great stairway, and a hundred or two more upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I reached the first of them, with Sonya running fleet as a
faun behind me. The girls, unarmed, scattered to give us
room. We dashed through to the foot of the stairway, began
mounting it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls on it made way for me. But, halfway up, I saw
above me, three girls with swords. They stood their ground,
and whirled to oppose me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Others with swords were near them and turned at me also,
and above them, I was aware that the guards were coming
down from the top to attack them from behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stopped, and thrust Sonya in front of me. “You tell your
girls to get out of the way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She screamed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Again, Sonya! Tell them to get off the stairway! Fools!
Can’t they understand I’m for them! Get them off here, I tell
you! I’ll handle those guards up there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It stung Sonya into action. She shouted my commands,
rushed up a few steps, waving the girls aside. Behind me, they
were retreating, clearing the stairway. Above they stood undecided,
with awkwardly brandished swords, undecided
whether to oppose me or to turn to defend themselves from
the guards coming down from above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then one girl came, passing me hurriedly along the edge
of the broad steps, then another. Then they all came with a
rush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And presently the stairs above me were empty, up to near
the top where the guards had retreated and now stood with
drawn swords gazing down at me. Empty steps, save for a
girl’s white body lying head down in a crimson pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I started slowly up. “Keep behind me, Sonya—careful!
You’ll be safe enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In silence I mounted toward that line of swords. The
guards stood a moment in doubt. Then from the castle roof
one of the old men screamed a command. The guards answered
it. With a leap they came surging down the top steps to
rush me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I raised the Frazier muzzle, pressed its trigger. Its pale-green
beam sprang out through the moonlight. I waved it
lightly, and it spread, painting the oncoming guards with
its thin, lurid color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first of them fell; his sword clattered; his body came
hurtling down. I swept Sonya aside to avoid it. Another fell,
but held to a step, lying huddled. Two others sank to their
hands and knees, stiffened, awkwardly propped against the
steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dozen more were standing frozen of movement, with
swords held stiffly outstretched. And a few retreated woodenly
to the top level where they stood swaying drunkenly, stupidly
regarding me, hypnotized by the power of my will which
the Frazier beam had intensified and thrown at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I snapped off the beam. Its effect, with my flashing glance
to aid it, would last five minutes or more. Hypnotized in the
modern sense, very much as the ancients claimed they could
do it with the eyes alone, and mysterious passes of the hands,
these men here now, to some extent, would do my bidding.
Certainly, they were powerless to move, save as I might direct
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I swung on Sonya. “They’re not hurt! Not injured! Tell
the crowd; tell everyone it’s an evidence of power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down in the garden the throng was pouring out the gates
in a panic, hundreds milling at the gates, trying to escape.
They quieted somewhat at the sound of Sonya’s shrill voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We mounted past the stricken guards. They moved slightly;
they were recovering. At the top, I stood, and with vehement
thoughts commanded them to move aside. They swayed,
moved a few steps, like sleep-walkers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurry, Sonya! They’re recovering! Tell your girls to stay
where they are, down there! If they move, I’ll strike them as
I struck the guards. Tell them that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lone hand! But I was winning. We came to the front of
the balcony stairway. The guards up there had vanished in
fright. I mounted the steep stairs, with Sonya close under
me. Down on the terrace top, the guards had recovered, but
they were too frightened to do anything but stare up at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I reached the balcony, moved to where there was no door
behind me, where I could not be attacked unawares. And I
drew Sonya to the balcony rail. Beneath us in the yellow
moonlight the great throng of men, the girls, and the vanquished
guards stood silently gazing up at me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Sonya, I’ll talk to them! Tell them I am Leonard
Gray, the Earthman. Remind them that their king is dead;
their prince is captured by a horrible unknown enemy that
menaces us all! Tell your girls that they shall have justice.
Tell the men that we are going to rescue our prince! All of
us united, not fighting one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell them they have seen a little of my power. I want to
use it for them, for you all, not against you! All of us united
to rescue our prince. And until that is done—Leonard the
Earthman is their ruler!”</p>

<div><h1>XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE PRISONER IN THE CAVE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Jim had been received by the dying king. For what seemed
hours he sat with Ren in a castle room waiting to be admitted
to the royal bedside. To Jim it was irksome. He was afraid
the king would die, afraid something would go wrong, and
we would all be held as prisoners again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he finally saw the king. Jim took the oath of allegiance,
swore he would do what he could to rescue the prince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They started back through the city streets. At this time I
was with the girls on the Island of the Virgins. The moon
had just risen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were in the main lower street before our house. The
moon was still low at the horizon; its light was cut off by the
houses. The street lamp shone full on the railed flower bed,
but close to the buildings, under the pedestrian levels, the
shadows were black. Jim suddenly became aware of peering
green eyes, a black shape that leaped at him. Other shapes,
with great wobbling heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A giant shape of human form had knocked Ren down.
Another struck Jim, bore him with its weight to the pavement.
His senses faded from a blow on the head, and blackness,
smothered by clanging gongs in his ears as he lost
consciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment, after an interval of what length he never
knew, knowledge that he was still alive came to him. He
seemed to remember that a giant manlike shape with a bullet
head had leaped upon him. It had another head, huge,
wobbling like a balloon. But the large head had fallen off it;
the large head lay on the ground, with tiny arms supporting it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The phantasmagoria of a dream. But Jim’s head was clearing
now, just a little. Something was holding him, and he
could feel movement—a rhythmic jogging. He opened his
eyes. A city street was passing. A great hairy arm was about
his middle; he was being carried by something that walked;
being held horizontal, his head, arms and legs dangling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A giant, brown, hairy shoulder was over him; and above
that, the great bulge of a head—a smooth, dead-white inflated
membrane—a head that bounced and wobbled as the
thing strode forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A brief consciousness, a vague, dreamlike impression, scarcely
strong enough to make a memory, and Jim’s senses again
faded into a black void of silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Jim came fully to himself he was lying in a glow of
yellow moonlight. Beneath him was a smooth, curving metal
surface. His head ached horribly; a lump was upon it, and
there was matted blood in his hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was sore, bruised all over, but with returning strength
he realized that he was not seriously injured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lay a moment, trying to remember what had happened,
and the memory came, distorted and vague. Over him spread
the canopy of stars, with a great yellow moon rising. The
curving metal surface beneath him was gently swaying. Was
he on a boat? He was still no more than half conscious. He
murmured, “Ren! Ren!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Jim? Jim, is that you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim struggled up on one elbow. Ren was sitting hunched
beside him. Ren—alive, seemingly uninjured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were on a boat, lying in its bottom, a small, narrow
metal boat, six feet wide perhaps, and perhaps five or six
times as long. Its gunwale curved up two or three feet over
Jim’s head. They were lying in the narrowing of its bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farther astern, in the yellow moonlight, were figures,
brown, hairy bodies—men; or were they giant gorillas? They
had small bullet-like heads, faces flat-nosed, with receding
forehead and receding chin, and two small eyes that blazed
green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim very slowly sank back, but in a posture where he
could see the length of the boat. The figures there were not
animals; they were men of brute force and brute intelligence.
Four of them, with powerful, hairy bodies, wide-shouldered,
deep-chested, with short, thick legs and very long arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were clothed in what seemed trunks of animal skin,
and a skin fastened over the bulging chest to one shoulder.
And each had a broad, tightly drawn belt at his waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Jim came the memory of his capture. It was no fantasy,
his memory of a hairy body, with a balloonlike, wobbling
head. The four huge heads were here now, in a group near
the center of the boat. Each was about four feet in diameter.
A dead-white membrane, with bulging, distended veins on a
forehead, over a grotesque flat face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heads, belonging to these four bodies? Jim realized it was
not that. These were separate living entities, which had been
riding astride the shoulders of the four.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Intelligent, reasoning beings—it seemed monstrous to call
them men—beings which were nearly all brain, just as the
others were nearly all body, heads so distended that they
sagged of their own weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he regarded them, Jim became aware that to each of the
great heads a shrunken semblance of body was attached.
Two tiny arms, which came out directly from the sides of the
head, and were now turned down, with hands pressing the
boat to give balance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the wide, convex face, beneath what might have
been a bloated chin, a shriveled body dangled: a trunk and
legs some two feet long. They lay shriveled beneath the heads.
Useless appendage! But all of these shrunken, dangling bodies
were clothed with colored fabric, and upon the breast of one
was an ornate metal ornament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim whispered: “Ren?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Something struck me. Then somebody,
something was carrying me. Men! I heard their voices. I tried
to scream; a hand went over my mouth. I knew we were
captured. I thought—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! Not so loud! They’re here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with us now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. They were talking a while ago. They—hear
them now, Jim?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Low, gutteral voices sounded back there—the brute men.
The brains, the balloon heads, were talking also, low, suave
voices in a foreign tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim! Jim, one of these men here in the boat with us—”
Ren’s voice held a quiver of fear. “He’s, Jim, I can receive
thoughts now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like Dolores did from a distance. It seemed,
just a little while ago, that I was getting Len’s thoughts.
He was triumphant, exulting over something. But it was gone.
Then I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You get the thoughts of someone here in the boat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I guess so. Someone .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the thought came to me that
he called himself Talon. I just now got it again. Talon. He’s
been studying thoughts from me. Putting them into my language.
He’s doing it now. It’s very easy for him, studying
my thoughts, our words .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my words to you now. He can
understand them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear us now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Or hear the thought of our words. We can’t escape!
Can’t do anything secretly! He’s laughing at us. He—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim saw one of the heads raise itself up on its hands. Its
shriveled body hung limp, the body with the ornate cross on
its breast. The arms bent, then straightened with a snap; the
head bounded a foot or two in the air, landed again on its
hands, and again leaped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was hitching itself the length of the boat, its shriveled
body trailing after it. One of the giant, hairy brutes of men
moved aside to let it pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim whispered, “It’s coming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A revulsion of horror swept him—a repugnance to have this
great bloated head come near him. He strove to master the
horror. This was a man. Strange of form, but a living, mortal
being. A man—an enemy. Nothing supernatural, not gruesome,
merely strange, an enemy with whom he had to cope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim sat up abruptly. His shoulder touched Ren’s. From
down the boat the bloated head came hitchingly forward. A
few feet from Jim and Ren it stopped, rested with a slight
swaying upon the tiny body hunched under it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim stared into a huge, convex face: round green eyes,
holes, a circular rim of them, for nostrils, a wide mouth,
thin-lipped. The mouth seemed almost a human feature; it
was smiling. A soft, suave voice said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Talon.” And corrected itself, “I mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am
Talon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to Jim in that instant that with those few
spoken words the thing itself had removed most of the horror
with which its outward aspect invested it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sense of relief swept over Jim. His tenseness relaxed. He
said slowly: “What do you want of us, Talon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Talon.” His arm had a hand, with a sheaf of
broad, flat fingers. He pointed to the ornament hanging on
the chest of his shrunken body. “Talon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. leader of my
people.” He spoke haltingly, groping with the unfamiliar
words, and carefully, as though to avoid error. “Called
Talon. You .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lie quiet and soon my words are more. I study.
Lie quiet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. until I speak again.” He gestured. “Lie
quiet, or—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another more vehement gesture. It embraced Jim and Ren.
Jim understood the threat. The voice repeated very calmly,
“You had better lie down .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>now</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes seemed leaping pools of green fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sank back. With his elbows slightly raising him, Jim
watched the head of Talon hitching itself to the stern of
the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon had risen high above the horizon. From where
Jim lay he could see its yellow, horn-shaped disk. That, and
a narrow segment of the star-strewn sky, was all that showed
above the gunwales of the boat. The stars rolled with a lazy
swing; the boat was throbbing, propelled evidently, by some
invisible engine, over a calm, rolling sea, and in the silence
Jim could hear the water slipping past the boat’s smooth sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wondered how far from shore they were? If he and
Ren, with a leap, could plunge overboard, a mad, fool-hardy
attempt, of course, but still he must see where they
were, try and plan something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ren?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Move over a little. I’m going to get behind you and sit
up, see where we are, how far from shore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim cautiously raised his head. He half expected a command
from the rear of the boat. But none came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were on a broad expanse of calm water. The moon
made a yellow shimmering path into which they were heading.
Jim sank back. It would have been folly to have attempted
an escape. For a long time he and Ren lay quiet.
An hour, perhaps, or more. The boat sped rapidly on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Its invisible engine made a hiss, and a line of bubbles rose
from its sides. Jim had noticed them when he sat up; the boat
seemed traveling on a continuous, rising mass of bubbles.
There was a queer acrid smell in the air from the gas of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim learned later from Talon the details of this boat. It
was built of metal which, with its load, would barely float.
Beneath its hull was a chamber through which the water
circulated. A grid of wires was there; a current heated the
wires, decomposed the water into its two component gases,
hydrogen and oxygen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bubbles were buoyant. The rising flow of them lifted
the boat, so that in truth it skimmed forward upon the gas
bubbles beneath it. The generation of gases was controlled,
so that the boat floated high or low at will. The engine was
similar. The forcible ejection of gases from a tube extending
under water from its stern propelled it forward. The tube was
movable, like a rudder, to give direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour passed. Then the hairy brutemen who had been
sitting quiet got to their feet, fumbled at the gunwales. An
oval metal cover rolled from beneath the gunwales up like
a canopy to enclose the boat overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim had taken a last swift look outside, before the arched
metal cover rolled and closed them in. The boat was now
making for a sheer wall of cliff that lay directly ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in one place, for which they were steering, the cliff
dropped sheer, unbroken into the water. Above the cliff,
behind it, a jagged mountain range stood yellow in the
moonlight, tumultuous, naked crags.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cover closed overhead. A tiny green light winked on.
Within the boat, lurid in the green glow, the four brutemen
moved about with swift activity; the soft voice of Talon was
directing them; his great head was raised on his hands as he
followed their movements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They bolted the metal over, adjusted other mechanisms
which now came into use at the stern. A lessening of the
flow of gas from beneath the hull; the water filled the
chamber there. The rear power tube now pointed downward,
to dip the bow. Other tubes, one on each side below the
water line, pointed upward, with powerfully ejected streams
of gas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bow of the boat dipped; it sank beneath the surface.
Jim had no idea then of the mechanisms, but he knew the
boat was under water. One of the great heads was busily
adjusting a mechanism to purify the air they were breathing.
Another was seated at what seemed a mirror; gazing ahead
through the water, steering the boat with his fingers on a row
of buttons which governed the controls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another hour. Jim and Ren whispered occasionally. The
boat was speeding uninterruptedly beneath the surface. At
last Jim called,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. What is it?” the head of Talon answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here. You can talk better now, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talon evidently was amused at the imperative tone. “Yes.
I can talk better now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came hitching forward; his great face was broken by
a grotesque grin. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you?” Jim demanded. “What do you want of us?
Where are you taking us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talon was willing to talk. He sat, his fingers toying with
the metal ornament, his head resting against the side of
the boat for support. He and his fellows were of a race
which he called the Intellect. They came from a distant world
in the sky, a dark planet, satellite of one of the remote suns up
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five thousand or more of them, adventurous Intelligences
like himself, had built a great ship and come to this foreign
world. They had landed in mountains, a wild, desolate
country. Their ship had been destroyed, irreparably broken
in landing. They could not get back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were, he explained, in this distant world two distinct
races of beings, those like himself, for countless ages
bred to develop the intellect so that their bodies shriveled and
dwindled from disuse, all their physical powers nearly gone.
And another, quite opposite race, bred for physical strength
and power, the brutemen, of slight mental capacity but
powerful of body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gestured. “You see four of them? They do our bidding
unquestioned. They supply the body for us; we are the mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ride on their shoulders,” said Jim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talon’s eyes gleamed. “We more than ride on them.” He
showed Jim where from beneath his head a ropelike sinew
depended. “This we fasten upon a nerve-center of their backs.
Their little brain is dulled, unconscious then of existence.
Our brains take command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The body is ours, for the time! We can feel its physical
power; our brain animates it. We are one being. One entity
when that connection is made.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ren spoke up softly, “Why did you go to that city where
you captured us? Those people there haven’t harmed you.
But you captured their prince and princess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The huge face grinned with a look of cunning. “We cannot
get back to our world. We do not like these bleak mountains,
these dark caves where we have been living. We must
have a better land, and other people; we want to establish
our own race. And there is little food, here in the mountains.
We began wandering, searching. We brought this one boat
with us from our own world.” He described the workings of
the boat, and went on. “One day I came upon that man and
that woman you call prince and princess. He says he is called
Altho. They escaped from me, climbed to a cliff. But we
caught them again finally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused. Then he added slowly: “The princess is dead
now. I did not want her to die .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but the prince killed her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It brought a shudder to Jim. He said, cautiously, “What
are you going to do now? What do you want of us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking that if you were important, like Prince
Altho, to this other world, I might offer to release all of you,
not kill you, if they would let us live among them in the city.
But I have decided now not to bother with that. I think, if
you annoy us too much, we shall kill you before we start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Start where?” Ren demanded. His voice was steady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Start upon our attack. We brought little with us from our
world, a few devices and scientific supplies; but for all this
time since we arrived we have been manufacturing. It is
difficult with so few materials at hand. But we are nearly
ready. When I return now, we will start our last preparations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice rose to a sudden grim power, “We have prepared
well for this conquest. It is a beautiful land down there; the
women, so many of them like the princess, are very beautiful.
The men, they are not like you two—they are already
afraid of us. Some have seen us wandering near the cave
entrances. They always run in terror.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chuckle had a horrible gloating. “They will be easy to
kill. A swift attack upon the city; we are almost ready for
it now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat at last came to the surface; the cover rolled back;
the stars gleamed overhead as before, but the yellow moon
had crossed the sky and was falling to the horizon behind
them. Jim saw that they had come to the surface of a very
small lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could see all around its shore, a circular lake of black,
cold-looking water. It lay unrippled, smooth as polished black
stone, unbroken except as the boat’s gas bubbles rose, and by
the V-shaped waves the boat left behind it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Around the shore was a ring of mountains. Bleak, naked
cliffs of rocks came down sheer to the water; behind them
the mountains rose in tumbled, serrated ranks, naked crags
and spires, snow-capped with yellow snow where the moonlight
struck them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here in the remote mountain fastness, Talon had established
his stronghold. This was an isolated lake, which a
subterranean boat had been plowing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Jim’s elbow, Talon said, “These mountains seem to extend
back endlessly. But I have another base already established
on the Warm Sea, and from there I will make my
attack. I have planned well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ahead of them, in one small place the mountains were
broken. A narrow canyon-like valley was open to the water,
with a fringe of black-sand beach. Cave mouths showed along
the sloping valley sides. Lights moved. The mouths of the
caves were outlined by a green-white glare from within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat landed on the black beach. Brute figures crowded
around it in the fading moonlight, sinister giant figures. Huge
gruesome heads came bouncing forward over the sand.
Voices sounded. Questions. The voice of Talon shouted
commands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half a hundred of the brutemen lifted the boat bodily
from the water, deposited it on the beach. Jim and Ren were
carried up the valley, and into the green glow of a cave
mouth. Ren seemed entranced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prince Altho faced Jim and Ren in the dimly lighted
cave. Talon had left them. At the cave-mouth, barely beyond
sight and hearing around an angle of its narrow entrance
passage, two of the brutemen stood on guard. Altho’s cave
had been his home during most of his captivity. Jim saw it as
a small room of glittering black rock, dimly lighted with pale
green radiance from a ceiling tube from which green-glowing
wires depended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a bed of skins, crude stone furniture, a mere
slab of rock for a table, upon which food now lay. Draped
skins walled off a corner where the bed was placed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altho could not talk with Jim, but he very soon established
that he was friendly. He was a man about Jim’s height, this
prince, but delicate, almost frail of build. A handsome square-jawed
face, had the delicacy of royalty stamped upon it. A
high, white forehead was topped with curly hair like pale
gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled and shook his head at Jim’s voluble words. He
shook hands with smiling puzzlement at Jim’s insistence. He
seemed to understand Ren’s condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat, earnestly trying with gestures and words to make
each other understand. Hours passed. Altho prepared some
skins for beds, and gestured that they should sleep. Ren lay
down, but Jim refused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another interval. A bruteman came with food. One of the
heads, like Talon, came hitching itself in, looked around,
spoke to Altho, and withdrew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim ate some of the food. He had thought Ren was asleep,
but when he questioned him, Ren sat up at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim, what are we going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim was wondering that himself, and wondering also what
fate Talon had in store for them. Abruptly Ren murmured,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awhile ago, Jim, I was sure I was getting someone’s
thoughts. Not Talon’s; he’s hiding them from me now. Someone
like Len, or Dolores. Or perhaps it was Sonya.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim’s heart leaped. Something was impending! He sat between
them tensely; his hand touched Altho’s arm; his eyes
flashed at Altho with eager questioning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ren murmured, “I’ve got it now, Jim! It’s Sonya! She says,
<span class='it'>I am Sonya. We know you are with Altho. I am getting his
thoughts too!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A silence. Altho sat cross-legged on the stone floor, as Jim
and Ren were sitting, with the stone slab of table before
them; the green glow of light nearby threw shadows behind
them. Altho was sitting with closed eyes, his hands to his
temples. He looked up momentarily; his gaze rested on Jim
and Ren with a new understanding, a new friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ren murmured, “She’s telling Altho about us. She says,
<span class='it'>Hold connection! I’m telling him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he’s telling me</span>—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altho’s lips were moving with his thoughts to Sonya. The
girl, over all this distance, was translating from the universal
language of thoughts for these two strangers at Jim’s elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ren added, “Altho says to us in his thoughts, Talon had
promised not to kill him; Talon now thinks he will be useful
after our city of Kalima is conquered. But one of Talon’s
men—that head who was in here a while ago—he said they
had decided we all three were to die. I’m asking Altho what
he thinks we can do to escape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altho raised his head at the question; his eyes searched
Ren’s face. His lips moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim! Jim, she says, <span class='it'>We are coming to try and rescue
you! If you or Altho can direct us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we’re coming .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
in the air now.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altho was on his feet. He seemed to be warning Sonya
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” cried Ren. “Altho says no, they must not come! But
they’re coming! Sonya and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she doesn’t say who’s coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altho and Jim stiffened. From the entrance passage a figure
had emerged, a giant, hairy bruteman. He stood with swaying,
dangling arms, green eyes blazing in the pale green
cave light; a leer on his small flat face, a black tongue like an
animal’s, licking his black lips with murderous anticipation!</p>

<div><h1>XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CROWDED HOURS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya,” I exclaimed vehemently, “stay beside me! Don’t
leave me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How I cursed my inability to speak this language during
those crowded hours following the king’s death! At every
turn, with every move I was handicapped, the force of my
words lost since I had only a girl for mouthpiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Sonya did well. The crowd in the garden had dispersed;
Sonya had led the girls into cheering me. I had made
a speech promising them justice in their cause, and sent them
away, not to the Virgins’ Island, but peacefully back to the
homes they had left. They were glad to go; there was no
government now to force them into a distasteful marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guards had come before me, at first with an indecision,
a sullenness, but the old men counsellors had swiftly
abdicated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell them, Sonya, I want all their advice; whatever they
think should be done, I will listen.” I strode up and down
the huge audience chamber of the castle, while the old men
watched me with whispered, frightened words among themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was so much to do! I had made a speech to the men
in the garden before they dispersed. Our prince must be
rescued. They had a man of power and action leading them
now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My words, and perhaps my aspect as I stood up there in
the moonlight, aroused them to enthusiasm. They were men.
Courageous. Patriotic. They had never yet had a real leader.
But they had one now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It stirred me, as I had stirred them, when I heard them
cheering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I summoned the chief of the guards before me, a slim,
straight young fellow with flashing eyes. When I demanded
his allegiance—he and all his fellows’—he swung on his heel
to the old men who were ranged along the side of the room.
They nodded timorously, and he turned back and bowed
before me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him, Sonya, that I want ten of his men always patrolling
the castle grounds. And others, he can use his judgment
as to numbers, patrolling the city. If there is any sign of
disturbance, notify me at once. I want the people all to go
to their homes and stay there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was so much that I did not know! “Sonya, are there
any cities beside Kalima?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said. “Only small villages. And there is the village
on the Virgins’ Island.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded. “I want messengers sent out, to tell everyone of
the change of government and a warning to beware of the
Nameless Horror. It is abroad; it may appear anywhere.
Have the people in the rural districts gather food and bar
their homes, stay indoors. Sonya, who has been in charge of
organizing the army?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She named him, but it transpired that there had been
nothing at all done, as yet, except a manufacturing of the
weapons of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send him to me,” I ordered. “And the leader of the
scientists—he has been in charge of the manufacturing? I
want to see him also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crowded hours! And I could not leave those girls on the
Virgins’ Island; a few of them had remained there with the
old women and children. I ordered them all brought in;
ordered such of them as could to return to their former
homes; the others were to be quartered in the castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hours of swift, decisive commands followed. And there was
no one in that busy castle, save possibly Sonya, who realized
how I was groping. The government I had seized—<span class='it'>I</span> was the
king now—a simple, primative organization, but to me, so
ignorant of its workings, it seemed complex indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I was learning. One by one, I had the leaders of its
various departments brought before me, and from each,
though they did not realize it, I learned a little more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all very human. None were very hostile to the
virgins; many now hoped they would be given their way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All were afraid of the Nameless Horror, but all loved their
prince very dearly. It seemed that I would have no trouble
with internal conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya soon realized it. Her voice carried a more commanding
ring. Poor little Sonya! After hours of translating,
issuing my commands, running my errands, she was on the
verge of exhaustion. But, as in us all, the spirit of battle
was upon her. An enemy was at our doors, and soon everyone
realized that every command I issued was to make us
stronger to resist that enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been well over an hour after my abrupt seizure of
the castle, before I even thought of Alice and Dolores. They
were unharmed. Sonya had kept them away from the castle
steps; for half an hour they had been in the room with me,
watching and listening with wide eyes and solemn faces,
a half hour before I saw them. They did not question, but
ran to Sonya and me to be of such help as they could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once Alice insisted, “You must rest, Leonard. You can’t
keep this up, you and Sonya.” I had never before seen the
light of love for me in her eyes, but I saw it then!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had sent the girls into a castle room to sleep. At last I
was alone with food, and a hot stimulating drink, like coffee,
before me. I was seated at a table, in the king’s huge chair.
<span class='it'>I</span> was the king. Alone here in my audience room. Through
the windows, the falling moon threw a yellow glow. The time
of sleep was nearly over. The city was awakening; I could
hear its voice awakening to the round of daily activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My city now! But the thought brought no exultation. This
new day would be dark like the other. If the Nameless Horror
were abroad in the city—Had I not better form an armed
street patrol? And keep the people indoors? I needed more
messengers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young men from the outlying districts must be ordered
in to enroll with my recruiting staff. Suppose the people outside
of Kalima revolted against me? Would I have to go out
and overawe them with the Frazier beam?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maxite, the scientist was coming back to talk with me
presently. I thanked God that he at least had learned from
Ren my language. So much to do, and I was so tired!</p>

<p class='pindent'>My head fell to my hands on the table. Alone there at last
in the great, silent room, I fell asleep.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been asleep, highness. I did not want to awaken
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maxite sat across the table from me. I aroused myself,
rubbing my eyes, embarrassed at my undignified position.
Maxite had evidently been sitting there a long time, waiting
for me to have my sleep out. The moonlight was gone. The
windows were black rectangles, the stars hidden by dark-gray
cloud masses. But the city was awake, its new day now
fully advanced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maxite smiled. He was a small, gray-haired man of middle
age, black-robed, with gray ruching at his throat and wrists,
and with a yellow ball ornament dangling from a chain at his
neck. He said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Others, too, are waiting to have your orders, highness.
But we knew you needed rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the farther door of the large apartment a group of men
and a few girls were standing. One by one, I saw them. My
chief of the guards reported that the city seemed normal; the
Nameless Horror had not appeared. A messenger from the
rural districts along the Warm Sea said the people were
frightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were obeying my orders to stay indoors; but the
young men were demanding that I let them come at once
to Kalima, to get from me weapons with which to defend
their families.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three girls presented themselves, with a petition that the
girls be allowed to join my army. Five hundred names were
on it. A fat, affluent-looking individual, a wealthy land owner
he told me, came to present his claim to immediate marriage
to a girl who was now returned from the Virgins’ Island. I
sent him brusquely away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was some confusion over the return of the refugees
from the island. Some of the infants could not be returned
to their homes; the mothers were afraid to have them. Some
of the virgins lived in the rural sections; they wanted their
parents brought into the city for greater safety. And some of
the old women had not been welcomed home, and had been
brought to the castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did my best to straighten it out. Enlistment in my army
had already begun. I interviewed three trainers of the military
animals, for use on land, in the water, and in the air. The
animals were ready. The mechanical equipment was very
nearly complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sent word to the rural districts for all young men to come
in and present themselves to my recruiting officers. And any
family that wished, could come also. I issued a proclamation
to the city, that all homes be prepared here in Kalima to care
for at least one family of refugees, at government expense if
necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Expense! My national treasurer was already in despair. I
knew almost nothing of my nation’s finances, but I did not
admit it. I would learn, devise some methods of raising
money. Already a dozen ways were springing to my mind.
That fat, middle-aged landowner, for instance, he and others
like him would not be so rich when I got my government
properly operating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maxite and I were alone again. “Come,” I said. “I’m ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had planned that he would show me through the
arsenal. I wanted first to see the small hand weapons.
Maxite had told me that we had a room with a thousand or
more electronic needle pipes, a simple hand device which
generations ago had been used for hunting birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The army would be equipped with it, Maxite planned. I
thought, too, if it were sufficiently simple, I would send it into
the rural districts, so that each home might be armed for
defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want also,” said Maxite, “to show you our aerial image-finders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These, which he had already described, I needed at once.
Our enemy—I still could only call it the Nameless Horror—probably
had a base near Kalima. Prince Altho perhaps was
in captivity there; Jim and Ren, if they were alive, might be
there also. This aerial device might enable me to locate the
enemy base.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maxite and I were descending into the lower floors of the
castle. We passed rooms where the refugees were huddled.
Girls had been organized to care for them. On another, still
lower floor, I saw my guard pacing back and forth through
dim stone corridors. We were now below the terrace level, but
higher than the level of the back street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We descended other floors, came to a narrow dark corridor.
This, Maxite told me, was at the street level of the back
castle wall. I remembered walking along that curving street,
at the base of the wall, remembered a small door there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s here,” said Maxite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We stood in a dim blue radiance at the intersection of two
corridors. Ahead lay a floor-opening, where down a flight of
curving stone steps was the entrance to the first of the subterranean
arsenal rooms. To the right, a branching passageway
led to the small street gateway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A guard is there,” said Maxite, “armed with a fire-flash
for close-range work. He could kill anyone who came near
him. Oh Grett!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He called the guard but there was no answer. His soft
voice echoed between the narrow passage walls. We hastened
to the gate door. The guard was not there! But in the darkness
we heard a sound. Maxite’s hand-wire in its blue tube
flung a faint beam around us. On the stone flagging a figure
lay twisting. We had heard the scrape of its movement. It was
the guard, lying there bound and gagged!</p>

<div><h1>XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>FUGITIVES IN THE STARLIGHT</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I had sent Alice, Sonya and Dolores into one of the castle
bedrooms. They were all tired and overwrought with the
excitement through which they had passed. A dream awakened
Sonya, after how long an interval she did not know—several
hours undoubtedly. She dreamed she had been talking
with Prince Altho: he was in a cave; Jim and Ren were
with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long time Sonya lay pondering. Then she awakened
the other two girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, I want to go and try and rescue Altho.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told them her plan. They could take a small flying
platform, with a few birds. Once away from the city, the distraction
of the thought-waves of all its people, she would be
able to communicate with Altho or with Ren. Communicate
with them, find them—rescue them!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mad, impossible adventure, perhaps, but to the girls it
looked feasible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Alice, oh, Dolores, shall we try it? Leonard will be
many days getting his army together. That is too dangerous,
to wait so long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolores turned to her with shining, tearful eyes. “If I
could only get to Jim, help him to safety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya had other plans. She could get weapons, a small
weapon, the electronic needle pipe. She knew where they
were kept, and how to use them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard Ren discussing it one day with Maxite the scientist.
And there are image-finders stored in the same room.
I think I know how to use them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls decided to try it. They slipped unobserved from
the room. Sonya found them long, hooded black cloaks. In
the darkness, mingled with the confusion of arriving refugees,
they got out of the castle without being recognized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are we going?” Dolores whispered. They were all
three tense with excitement. Sonya had turned toward the
rear of the castle, into the dimly lighted street along the base
of the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A gate-door here,” she whispered. “It is guarded by Grett.
Quiet! Stand close beside me, but do not speak. But be
ready to do what I say. Soon we will have the weapons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the castle bedroom, before leaving, Sonya had tom a
garment into long, narrow strips, a staunch, tough fabric. She
handed the strips now to Alice. At the small door in the wall,
they paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep behind me,” Sonya whispered. “Over there in the
shadow. But be ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The street along here was dark; it was a street little used
and at the moment it was empty. Sonya knocked boldly on
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grett! Oh, Grett!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her own language from within came the muffled question,
“Who is there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Sonya.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I must not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only Sonya. Don’t you know my voice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. What do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve news from Ren. He is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oh Grett, you must let me
show you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was the sound of dropping metal bars. The doors
opened cautiously a trifle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya put her hand casually on the door. “It’s only Sonya,
Grett. See here what I have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tugged at the door. The guard was revealed, standing
with the leveled metal pipe in his hand. Sonya touched the
weapon. “Turn that away, Grett. It .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. frightens me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a low cry, a scuffle. Sonya had snatched the
pipe. She leaped backward, swung it level.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t move, Grett! Don’t make a sound! If you do I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ll
kill you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m desperate! Can’t you see it? Get back in there!” She
called softly, “Alice! Dolores! Here! Come inside, quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had backed the frightened, surprised young man into
the corridor, with leveled weapon and crisp menacing words.
In the glow of the passageway’s single light, she held the
weapon while Alice and Dolores bound the man’s legs and
arms with the strips of fabric. Sonya gagged him, and they
rolled him along the floor to the wall and left him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice was grim and pale, frightened at what they had
done. Dolores was trembling. “We haven’t hurt him, have
we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya bent down, loosened the gag a trifle. “No, he’s all
right. Lie quiet, Grett. And when they find you, tell them
you’re not to blame. Sonya tricked you. We may be back by
then, anyway, and I’ll take the blame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls hurried down the corridor, down the stone steps
into the arsenal room. Sonya had been here once before with
her uncle. The place was dark, but Sonya found a hand-wire
and Alice carried it above her head. Its light glowed dimly
blue, in a big room of fearsome shadows. Overhead they
could hear the faint tramp of a guard. Every moment they
expected to be discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya seized one of the electronic needle pipes, and the
range apparatus with which to operate it. And a large metal
cylinder in which was packed a group of image finders and
their aerial controls. With their loot under their cloaks, the
girls hastily retreated. At the gate-door they switched off the
corridor light. Sonya murmured, “Good-bye, Grett!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They closed the gate-door after them. From the outside it
appeared barred. With the cloaks shrouding them they hurried
to Sonya’s home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment they had six birds harnessed to a small platform,
and were in the air.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Within the cave, Altho, Jim and Ren faced the giant murderous
intruder. The bruteman stood licking his lips, an imbecile
leer on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a brief silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altho spoke soft, soothing words to the hairy giant, and
then ripped out a sharp command. It went unheeded. The
bruteman’s dangling hand came up to his belt. But never
reached it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim screamed an exclamation to Ren, and leaped. His
body struck the bruteman full, a solid impact which would
have flung Jim back, but the giant’s huge arm went around
him, lifted him like a child. As he went up, he flung his arms
around the thick, hairy neck and clung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His feet were high in the air as the bruteman straightened
with a savage, surprised cry. He tried to shake Jim off, but
Jim clung with one arm, with the other hand he gouged at
the giant’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altho had leaped. The giant kept his feet, swaying, kicking;
he stopped, and with an upflung arm, dashed Jim’s body
away. But Jim was back at him again, he and Altho, now,
clinging, kicking, gouging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Ren. The harrassed giant, fighting with scarce
the intelligence of a man, staggered across the cave with
Altho and Jim clawing at him. Their bodies struck Ren, and
scrambling in the dark, he caught a great hairy leg and
wound himself around it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the pale-green glow of the cave, the giant bruteman
surged about. He tripped, went down, with the three men
pounding on top of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim shouted, “We’ve got him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the giant was up, shaking them off, first one, then
another, tearing them loose, flinging them back. But always
they returned to claw at him. They fought silently, grimly, but
the giant roared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harrassed, frightened, Altho had torn his belt away and
flung it aside. The giant stood panting, looking around to see
where it had gone. Altho was gripping his thick middle firmly
with both hands; Ren was wound about his legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim had been flung away again. He was picking himself up,
but he stopped. He had seen a jagged, metallic projection of
the cave-wall. It seemed loose. Jim tugged at it. The swaying
bodies surged past him. He tugged, worked it loose. It came
free; in his hand he held a heavy, jagged chunk of black
metal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ren! Work him over this way! Over here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim leaped to the slab of table for greater height. The
giant’s back was to it. Jim could not talk to Altho, and
Altho could not see him. But he could hear Jim’s reiterated
call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bruteman tried to turn toward the insistent voice, but
Altho now understood and distracted his attention. And Ren
at his legs, was pushing him backward. A step; then another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came within reach of the table. Jim leaped into the
air. He struck the giant’s back; his hand went up, and the
heavy chunk of metal caught the bruteman full on the back
of the skull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He toppled, fell, writhing, jerking a moment, then lay still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They disentangled themselves from him, and stood up.
They were all three bruised and winded. There was a jagged
cut on Jim’s forehead; he dashed the blood from his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s get out of here! Now’s the time! Now, or never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altho’s pale face smiled at him questioningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim gestured. “Out .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. get out of here!” He added, “The
belt. What’d you do with the belt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The giant’s weapons. Altho could not understand the words,
but Jim saw the belt. He leaped over the huge, motionless
body. Outside the cave an uproar sounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altho called a warning; he was gesturing vehemently at
Jim to come. Jim seized a small metal object at random from
the giant’s belt, an egg-shaped thing of white metal: a muzzle-projection,
a handle and a trigger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lights were moving nearby in the darkness with a confusion
of voices. The second of the giant guards at Altho’s cave had
run away in fear. He was shouting, gathering other guards
around him. The huge heads were bouncing forward over the
rocks; calling commands. The brute-bodies were running to
them, each to his master. The heads were mounting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim turned to the right, up the valley. They were momentarily
in darkness, open metallic ground up a rocky slope,
stars overhead, lights and confusion behind them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They ran. Jim had handed the giant’s weapon to Altho,
thinking he would know better how to use it. They ran
swiftly. A tiny light to one side picked them out, then it
vanished. Jim pulled them sidewise to change their course.
Ren stumbled over the rocks as they ran, but they kept him
on his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim panted, “A cliff .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. over there! We can climb it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
or hide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altho glanced back. The lights were rushing on up the
valley. The fugitives were running between jagged, tumbled
boulders; Jim thought they had eluded the pursuit. But
suddenly ahead of them, a head rose on its hands from
behind a crag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim jumped for it. He struck it. His fist struck the great
face between its green blazing eyes. The face smashed,
cracked like the shell of an egg. Noisome! His fist sank
into a soft pulpy mass. He jerked it free. The head rolled
backward, the arms waving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on,” Jim shouted. He wiped his fist and arm on his
jacket: noisome, horrible!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re on the ledge, Ren .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can’t climb out of the valley.
It’s too steep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are they following us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I can see lights going up the valley. Altho seems
to want to lie here, not try to climb higher. If only I could
talk to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m trying to get Sonya’s thoughts, Jim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They lay on a dark ledge; a fifty foot drop was before
them, a sheer perpendicular wall. They had climbed beside
it, where the ground was broken. Over the ledge, some ten
feet above it, was another broader space with what seemed a
cave-mouth behind it. The crags were dim in the starlight;
black gulleys, ravines were everywhere. Below them spread
the valley floor. Lights which marked the pursuit had gone
past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a time the three fugitives lay quiet. Jim’s mind went
back to the cave from which they had escaped. Two of the
brutemen had been on guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These brutemen were hardly more than animals, like tigers
with a lust for human blood. One had murderously entered
the cave; the other, listening, had become frightened and
decamped, giving the alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim whispered impatiently, “Ren, can’t you get any
thoughts from Sonya?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I’m trying. I feel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I feel that Altho is getting
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed so. Altho was lying with his head down on his
hands. Once he uttered a suppressed exclamation, and then he
was murmuring as though to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right. He’s getting them,” Jim muttered. “Try again,
Ren!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abruptly Ren exclaimed, “They’re coming! Sonya, with
Dolores and Alice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do they know where we are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re trying to find us. Sonya says they haven’t seen
any lights yet to mark our valley. Altho has been trying to
direct them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, for a while we’re safe here. They—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim never finished. From down the valley, by the cave-lights
of Talon’s encampment, a ball of fire mounted slowly
upward, a tiny, blazing white ball. It rose in a slow arc, and
suddenly burst with a blinding white glare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The valley, the crags, the ledge upon which the fugitives
lay were all momentarily brilliantly illumined. Jim saw that
beneath them in the valley a hundred of the mounted heads
were gazing upward. And he knew too, that they had been
seen upon the ledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shout arose; a rush of the figures to climb. But a voice,
Talon’s voice, seemed commanding them to stop. Farther
down the valley, brutemen were dragging forward a heavy
piece of apparatus, a huge gun-muzzle on wheels, the muzzle
pointed vertically upward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim leaped to his feet. “We’ve got to get higher! Try to get
to that cave overhead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Altho pulled him back. Altho still held the weapon
Jim had taken from the giant. He gestured with it. Jim
sank back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something going on down there in the valley.
Jim wondered if the weapon Altho had was of any use at this
distance. Altho seemed absorbed in thought communication.
Suddenly from over the cliff-tops across the valley, a small
pink ball of light came sailing, floating out over the valley in
a huge segment of circle, a thousand feet in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A glowing pink ball; a concentrated radiance seeming to
whirl upon its axis, with tiny crescent streamers of light as it
whirled. It sailed in a curve above the valley, growing dimmer,
as though burning itself out, until in a moment it
vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim stared. But Altho knew what it was. He leaped to
his feet.</p>

<div><h1>XV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE RESCUE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The small flying platform, with the girls prone upon its fur
covering, sailed up from Sonya’s home and over the city. The
stars were obscured by gathering black clouds, a threatening
storm, but it did not break. Sonya headed the birds for the
Virgins’ Island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed a thousand feet above it where a barge drawn
by swimming sea animals below was bringing the women
and children back to Kalima. Sonya had only the general
direction of where she wanted to go, the length of the Warm
Sea toward the distant mountains and caves. The Nameless
Horror had been seen always in that direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls lay silent. Sonya was in constant, though sometimes
vague communication with Altho. She knew the captives
were in a cave; then she got the thoughts clearer, and
got Ren’s thoughts also. But suddenly all the thoughts were
broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The threatening storm passed. The moon was below the
horizon. But the stars came out clear and bright. The girls
were calmer now, grim with purpose. Sonya began connecting
their scientific apparatus, explaining it as well as she
could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The electronic needle pipe was a foot-long metallic pipe
with a diameter the size of a small human finger. It had a
large, round-metallic base, to be operated by two hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It projected a very small stream of electrons, which carried
with them a tiny, sharp-pointed fragment of metal, like a
needle. The needle flew with nearly the speed of light, expanding.
But when it struck it solidified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a range finder for aiming, and a device for
curving the electronic stream, so that the beam could be sent
to almost any degree of curvature. In her heart, though she
did not confess it even to herself, Sonya was dubious of her
ability to use the weapon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew she could not aim it with any degree of skill.
And she did not know its range. This needle pipe was a very
small size projector, with a range, she thought, effective only
a few hundred feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls were now beyond the Warm Sea, flying over a
broken, mountainous country, black and desolate looking in
the starlight. Altho’s thoughts were with Sonya again. They
had never been as clear as this before. A fight, an escape, a
dark ledge with a valley below it. There were lights in the
valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But where, in all this dark, mountainous waste, was that
valley? Sonya believed she was flying toward it. She had
several times in the last hour altered the direction of the
flight. Altho’s thoughts, a dim feeling of his approaching
nearness, seemed to guide her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very vague, an intuition more than a thought. Altho
himself did not know where he was, but the bond of love
between these two was very strong. Each could feel the
other’s approaching presence. He had tried to warn her away,
but when she persisted, he did his best to guide her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya murmured, “Now he says, <span class='it'>Lights in the valley—you
will see the lights.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But every desolate valley sweeping beneath them was pale
and wan in the starlight. Then Sonya prepared an image-finder.
She connected the batteries, the projector, and the
grid of glowing wires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice and Dolores held the grid between them. Sonya fired
the small projectile. It sailed off, a whirling pink ball. It was
in reality a small, flat disk with a lenslike eye and a whirling,
pink, glowing armature on top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over a radius of several miles Sonya’s <span class='it'>raytron</span> apparatus
could direct its flight, and back over the invisible connecting
ray came an image of all that the lens eye saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pink ball of light sailed ahead and soon was lost to
view. The grid of wires which Alice and Dolores held glowed
pink; then suddenly glared white. A glare of white showed
ahead in the sky. It was the light flare Talon had sent up to
locate the fugitives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flare went dark. The grid was pink again. Upon it,
etched in black, was a moving scene: mountains, crags, valleys,
moving in slow panorama, valleys all pale and empty in
the starlight. Then one showed dim, moving lights!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice cried, “Sonya .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lights! We see them now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya’s apparatus marked the position of the pink ball. She
turned the birds slightly, to fly after it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The platform was almost over the valley. Sonya sent out
another pink disk. The girls bent over the grid, staring at the
tiny movement image; a dim, starlit valley. At the bottom of
it, a group of busy figures and a giant projector muzzle
pointing vertically upward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls watched the grid breathlessly. Its image, moving
with constantly changing viewpoint, was clearly etched, but
dim and very small: a cliff ledge with three figures upon it.
From the ledge suddenly a small red ring of fire leaped out.
It sped downward, struck a rock, and vanished with a puff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Altho firing the weapon Jim had taken from the
giant; in a moment the still distant girls heard a report, like
a tiny clap of thunder, the sound of the red ring striking the
rock. Down in the valley the giant muzzle of the vertical
projector began issuing a stream of green light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It mounted a hundred feet, sprayed out like a fountain
column of water. From the ground, huge black figures tossed
a balloon head into the column of light. The head rose,
surged upward, until at the top it hung in the light spray,
balancing itself like a ball held at the top of a jet of water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all very swift, a moment or two while the girls
stared at the glowing grid. The head was nearly level with
the ledge. In the green light Altho’s figure showed plainly;
he was standing at the ledge, firing his red rings of flame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they were futile now. They floated slowly, and from
below, some hidden marksman was catching each of them
with an upflung pencil point of black light, a narrow beam,
so dead black that it showed clearly in the night. It caught
the red fire rings; its rays exploded them harmlessly in the
air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grid went dark; the second lens disk had burned out.
But the platform itself now swept over the valley. The reality
of the image scene was spread beneath the girls. Sonya saw
the ledge was large enough to land upon; she guided the
birds toward it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised the electronic needle projector, fired it with a
futile aim and then cast it away. There was no time for her
to attempt to use it further. Her birds were swooping for the
ledge, and they needed her guidance. A moment, and they
would be there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But too late! The head in the fountain of green light held
something in his hands. A hum rose over the valley. Altho,
standing on the ledge, suddenly flung up his arms. His
weapon fell from him. He toppled, seemed trying to draw
himself backward. But could not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, forward from the ledge his struggling figure
floated into the air. On the ledge, Ren and Jim were frantically
clinging to avoid being drawn after him. The hum rose
to a shrill whine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In what seemed a whirlpool of air, or the levitation of an
invisible magnetic stream, Altho was drawn to the head on the
supporting green light beam. The green light slowly diminished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head, with arms holding Altho’s unconscious body, was
lowered to the ground. A voice down there shouted hurried
commands. The lights all went out sharply. In the starlight,
Altho’s body was surrounded by dark surging figures, and
dragged away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The platform swooped to the ledge, landed with a thump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim! Jim! Are you all right?” It was Dolores’s anxious voice.
But Sonya was cold, shuddering. All her hopes were vanished.
She knew that they could not go down into the dark valley,
with all those armed figures entrenched in the caves. Altho
was lost to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim and Ren rushed to the platform. There was a moment
of confused greeting. Jim never knew how it quite happened,
but from the other ledge, ten feet above them, a head
like Talon suddenly leaped down. It flashed to Jim that the
head must all this time have been laboriously climbing in
the darkness. Or perhaps had followed some underground
passage to the cave up there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolores was standing slightly apart from the others. The
head seized her. On the upper ledge a giant bruteman was
leaning down; the head tried to lift Dolores to where the
dangling arms of the bruteman could reach her, arms which
would have pulled her and the head both up to the upper
ledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It happened so quickly, it was so utterly unexpected, that
Jim and the other two girls were for an instant stricken with
surprise. Dolores screamed. It was the first that they knew of
her peril. She called, “Jim! Jim!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ren was closer. He leaped before Jim, leaped in the
dark for the girl’s terrified voice. He struck the head with his
shoulder. His groping arms tore Dolores away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a spurt of flame from some weapon the head
was carrying. It caught Ren in the chest, drilled him. He fell
backward, lay motionless. But he had saved Dolores from her
captor. Jim and Alice had reached her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bruteman leaned swiftly down. The head held up one
of its small arms. The bruteman drew his master to the upper
ledge, with a jerk as though he were raising a large, light
ball. In the valley they were trying to raise another beam of
the green light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim was carrying Dolores; he threw her to the platform
and dragged Ren’s inert body aboard, with Alice grimly
helping him. Sonya screamed at the birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From above, the head was sending down tiny spurts of
flame. They struck the fur coverings with the acrid smell of
burning hair. Jim flung the girls behind him; every moment
he expected that the flame jets would strike him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only an instant, then the platform lifted, sailed
away. The ledge dropped beneath it. The dark, seemingly
deserted valley dropped and merged into the tumbled mountain
waste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The platform struggled on, sailing low. It was the Virgins’
Island now. The moon was rising again with its flood of yellow
radiance. Ahead, toward Kalima, they saw a blob in the
sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the large flying platform I had hastily equipped and
armed, coming out over the city to seek them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ren was dead.</p>

<div><h1>XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>DEPARTURE FOR BATTLE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>We were ready at last for our attack upon Talon’s forces.
The night had passed, and another long day, and night had
come again. Jim’s return, with what he had to tell us about
Talon, was of immeasurable help to me. I knew now what I
was facing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was tremendously helpful also in arousing public enthusiasm
for the war. The Nameless Horror was nameless no
longer. The people recognized that a savage enemy was at
their threshold, men who would have to be fought and conquered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not want a large fighting force, but I wanted it well
armed and trained, armed for defense also against what I
could guess Talon’s weapons might be. Jim had seen something
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sent out scouting platforms with the aerial image finders.
But they brought me little information, for presently Talon
realized what the pink balls of radiance in the sky meant.
He began destroying them with his black flash beam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was to be a war of weapons, rather than fighting
men. With Maxite, I labored to prepare a defense against
Talon’s black flash, and the fire rings which Altho had used.
Evidently Talon was armed chiefly with weapons of electronic
basis. I hoped so, for we could insulate against them fairly
efficiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day had just turned to night when news came that
Talon’s forces had left the mountains and now were encamped
at the end of the Warm Sea. It was what I had
hoped he would do. I had no intention of allowing him to
attack Kalima, but I did not want to go up into the mountains
after him. He was evidently ready now, but so was I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a busy time, those last hours. Kalima was jammed
with refugees. All along the shores of the Warm Sea the rural
districts were deserted. I mobilized my men and girls on the
castle grounds, and on the estuary there. The girls had had
their way; they were an important unit of my forces. I could
not refuse them, for they speedily demonstrated that in the
air they were far superior to the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Sonya and Maxite, I stood on the Castle terrace
watching the last details of our departure. The night was
clear, save for a low bank of clouds hanging over the sea,
with the horn-shaped yellow moon rising above it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The castle grounds were crowded with my eight hundred
fighting men, two hundred girls, the land animals, birds and
platforms. On the water were the boats, with sea animals to
draw them. I had some four hundred men in this division—a
total force of about fourteen hundred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A busy scene of moving lights, voices, commands, the fluttering
of the excited birds; behind us, on every housetop, in
every window and point of vantage in the city, a throng of
spectators watched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last preparations held a myriad details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maxite,” I said, “the platform with the Frazier beam—have
them hold it until last. Then I’ll come down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maxite’s orders went out over the aerial he carried on his
shoulder. I could hear the echo of his voice down there in
the garden. I swung the grid on my chest to catch the rays
from an image-finder erected on the waterfront. Alice and
Dolores were down there. I had not wanted them in this
fighting, but they insisted, and I had put them in the
division of boats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All ready, Alice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced up at the image finder; it stood on a post at
the shore front. On my grid was the image of her figure
standing there, with her insulated suit like a black cone
around her, and her helmet in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All ready, Leonard.” Her smile was grim, excited, tense,
but I could see no fear in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be careful, Alice. Keep Dolores with you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and obey
orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” She turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya, standing beside me, laid her hand on my arm.
“We’re going to win, Leonard. And Altho—” She gestured. “I
seem always to be getting his thoughts, Leonard. Again .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
just now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We knew that Altho was still alive, that Talon was going to
keep Altho with him. Sonya very often had fragmentary communication.
She had seemed to be getting it a few hours
ago, and now, suddenly, we realized what evidently Altho
had been trying to tell her. A messenger rushed up. He had
come from one of our scout platforms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talon’s forces had started for Kalima. The brutemen with
the heads mounted upon them were dragging heavy apparatus
along the shore road. And there were rafts on the sea
drawn by swimming brutemen. The rafts were already half
way to the Virgins’ Island!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no time to be lost. Maxite’s aerial sent his
voice to the seventy men and twenty girls who were equipped
to receive it. Each of them urged his squad to greater haste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The individual girl flyers rose first. One by one, each
mounted upon a giant bird, they rose from the castle grounds,
and began circling in the air. These girls were not protected
against Talon’s electric rays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was my plan to keep them very high in the air, beyond
what we estimated was the effective range of Talon’s black
flash. They were armed only with small explosive bombs, but
were expert at dropping them upon a mark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hundred and fifty of these mounted girls gathered now
in a hovering group, then in wedge-shape, flew in a wide,
slow circle. The birds were well-trained, capable of flying
swiftly to great heights. And the most agile of the young girls;
Sonya had selected them carefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This unit was the swiftest, most mobile of my forces. Sonya
was to lead it. She was presently ready, bringing up her
great gray bird, with its rug saddle upon which she would
recline on its back between its great spreading wings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was dressed, as were all the girls in the air squadron,
in a single dark flowing garment from shoulder to knee, with
her hair bound tightly in braids around her head. The small
metallic bombs were in a belt at her waist, bombs fitted
with a chemical most explosive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She offered her hand in my own fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye,” I said. “And remember, Sonya, keep well up,
and listen to my signals. Do not attack until I order it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaped upon her mount. It rose over me with dangling
legs; the rush of air from its wings was on my face. In a moment
I saw her up there, taking her place just below the girl
at the point of the wedge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the garden, the first of the flying platforms rose.
There were three of this size, each with twenty men and some
ten girls. Forty birds were harnessed to each platform: birds
in tandem along each side, and two long strings in front.
Four girls were to drive them; the other girls had bombs, and
the men had the smaller range electronic needle-pipes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These platforms were fairly swift. They were insulated
underneath, with the shaggy black fabric of woven wire
through which the insulating current circulated. And they
had side shields which could be raised; and dangling, insulating
curtains beneath some of the birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stood watching the three platforms as they rose majestically,
joined the mounted girls, and circled with them over
the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The land forces were starting. Jim was leading this division:
eight hundred men, most of them mounted individually
upon the giant <span class='it'>lops</span>—a four-footed animal, more like a giant
cat than anything I can name; handsome beasts, larger than
an earth-horse, with great claws, a mass of shaggy red hair,
and a tail like a plume of fur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each with a rider, they padded through the village streets.
Some were harnessed to our larger projectors, and our wind
device, which I planned to have Jim establish down the
shore opposite the Virgins’ Island. With it, Jim could lash
the narrow channel waters to a fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small land force passed into the city and vanished.
From the distant housetops I could see the waving crowd
to mark its progress. I turned away. The boats on the river
had started, a fleet of ten long, narrow, metallic boats, with
insulated sides and shields, boats drawn by sea-like mammals,
agile, swift, and intelligent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were some forty men and a few girls on each of the
boats. A large long-range needle projector was mounted in
the bow, behind the black screen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It could throw an electrified, imponderable blade of metal
over a curved path, with almost the speed of light for an
effective distance of over a mile. And these boats had light-flares,
wind projectors, and horizontal bomb projectors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sped down the estuary, with the mammals leaping
like dolphins in the water ahead of them; then they stopped,
circled, came back, and waited in a line in midstream. From
the city a great shout of enthusiasm went up at sight of
them. On one of them were Alice and Dolores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our three other flying platforms were long strings of birds,
our longest-range rising, heavier, smaller platforms, each with
weapons—a giant projector on each of them, with a few men
to handle it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maxite said, “We’re ready for you, Leonard.” He had
dropped, for the first time, my royal title. We stood, two
friends, parting with a handclasp. His face was very solemn.
I think he, too, was thinking of the homecoming. “I’ll follow
you with the finders, Leonard. Keep voice connection if you
can. Perhaps .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I will see what you might overlook, and I
can advise you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded. A simple handclasp. He turned away, to watch
our fate from his room beneath the castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My platform with the giant Frazier thought-beam we had
constructed, was ready. I was to operate it alone. I had
learned to fly its six birds. I clasped my black, cone-shaped
robe about me. My black helmet dangled like a hood behind
my shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ran down the castle stairway. From the city a roar of
enthusiasm went up. I turned and waved a hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Departure for battle! The people expected a martial gesture,
and I gave it to them. But within me was a shudder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I leaped on the black platform. It was no more than six
feet wide and twice as long, crowded with the projector, the
batteries and intensifiers, and much other scientific apparatus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I gripped the reins, shouted to the six birds whom I had
trained to know my voice and respond to my commands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My platform rose over the castle grounds. Around me, the
girls and the other platforms circled. Down in the estuary the
ten black boats were starting in a double line. Out beyond the
city, on the road toward the sea, a thin black line showed in
the yellow moon glow—Jim’s land division. The city beneath
me was a frantic, waving mass of humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shouted through my aerial. The girls and the platforms
broke their circle and started forward. With my platform
leading them, we swept in a great arc over the city, and
away into the moonlit sky.</p>

<div><h1>XVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE BATTLE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The Warm Sea was a body of water some one hundred miles
long by ten miles wide at most places. It lay in a bowl-like
depression of rolling country. Bays and caves indented its
shores in some places; in others cliffs came sheer to the
water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kalima lay at what I might term its southern end. The sea
broadened here into a sheet of water nearly twenty miles
wide, which I had learned to call Kalima Bay. To the north
it narrowed. The Virgins’ Island divided it, with a narrow
channel on each side, beyond which it opened again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the left along the west side of the sea, the road from
Kalima wound northward. The west channel of the Virgins’ Island
was very narrow—two thousand feet at the utmost—but
it was deep, with a sandy strip of beach on the mainland,
a bluff of fifty feet, with the road on top. It was along the
west side that Talon’s land forces were coming. And on the
same road from Kalima Jim’s force was marching to oppose
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our water division of ten boats headed into the center of
Kalima Bay, and there I halted them. They lay drawn in a
black ring on the placid water. To one side of me, the squadron
of girls flew now in a circle at about the threshold foot
level. The platforms hovered near them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Along the shore I could see the slow-moving line of Jim’s
army, crawling like a black snake over the winding, moonlit
road. I had hoped that the head of it would be approaching
the bluff near the west channel of the Virgins’ Island. But it
was not that far as yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke into my aerial. “Make it faster, Jim!” The image of
him showed his smiling face. Good old Jim, always smiling.
“Right,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this height there was no sign of Talon. Behind me,
from Kalima, Maxite had sent out an aerial image-finder. Its
pink whirling ball came sailing past me overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat enshrouded in my black insulated suit. I switched
the current into it; I could hear the current hum; smell its
faint acrid odor. The apparatus of the Frazier projector was
already assembled. The pulse-motor was on my wrist; the
head-band I now adjusted on my forehead. I made all the
connections, but I did not turn on the current.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before me were my smaller instruments. A bank of image-grids
was lashed here; voice receivers were at my ears, my
speaker aerial was on my shoulder. I caught the rays from
the image lens mounted in Maxite’s castle room. I tuned into
it, saw his pale, intent face, heard his grave voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No sign of Talon, Leonard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I’m holding the girls and the boats ready. I’ll go
higher myself—your lens just passed me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But it shows nothing yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll send one beyond it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good luck, Leonard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded and disconnected. Sonya was calling me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t we go forward?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the boats down there I caught Alice’s voice, but her
image did not register; it was dark in the boat behind the
black shields which enshrouded it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Len, have you seen Talon’s rafts yet? Mett says he wants
to know what our boats are to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing. Stay as you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. very careful of yourself, Leonard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said. I cut off, urged my birds upward. At nearly
ten thousand feet I hung poised. Far up the Warm Sea, on
the west road Talon’s approaching force was visible. And on
the water, I saw the black blobs of his rafts, four of them,
evidently huge affairs, crowded with men and apparatus. One
of them was in the yellow moonlit path. I could see the
swimming figures in the water, harnessed, drawing the raft
slowly forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pink ball I had sent out passed Maxite’s. It sped toward
Talon’s rafts. On my grid I caught a glimpse of the
wooden raft, with dead black beams standing up from it
vertically in the air. Hundreds of figures crowded there. A
black beam caught my whirling lens, burned it. The grid
went dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talon’s land force was almost to the Virgins’ Island channel
to the north. The rafts were over near that shore. It was
what I wanted to know. Talon would use the west channel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I dropped my platform downward, and adjusted my helmet,
though I kept its visor open. Talon’s land force would
reach the channel before mine could get there. I had hoped
that Jim would be able to set up our wind projector on the
bluff there to command the narrow water. But Talon would
be there first unless I could halt him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned to my aerial and gave the order for a general
attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I rose again, high in the air, and urged my birds forward.
Beneath me, the scene of battle spread out like a map of
three dimensions. Far down, our boats showed as tiny
blobs speeding through the west channel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were fast, but not so fast as the squadron of flying
girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya came leading them upward. They passed me, a giant
flying wedge heading over Talon’s rafts. There were four
rafts, three close to the shore, perhaps for protection of the
land force. But one of the rafts was farther out, separated
from the others. It was still several miles beyond the north
tip of Virgins’ Island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya’s squadron was the first to make contact with the
enemy. The girls headed for this isolated raft. They were
ten thousand feet or more above it. My heart was heavy
with apprehension. I could see the black rays from the raft
standing up into the air. Would they reach that high?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed not. The girls went safely over them, wheeled,
and came back. They had dropped a bomb. I saw a glowing
spot of light as it fell. It struck the water, wide of the raft.
A surge of water mounted upward, with a spot of red light
where the bomb had burst, then another, a score of them. I
began to hear their sharp reports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The raft was lashed by the waves, but still unhit. But the
brutemen pulling it were disorganized, many of them killed,
no doubt. The raft stopped its forward progress. Its black
beam wavered, then seemed to connect into one narrow
black ray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It shot up through the girls, cut a wide swath through
them. Some wavered, came fluttering down, falling, recovering,
limping slowly back toward Kalima, struggling to keep
above the water. Others fell like plumets into the sea. Half
our girls, undoubtedly, were killed or wounded by that single
black blast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our boats swept through the channel. Three stopped in
midstream; seven surged on. Lights flared, our lurid but penetrating
red flare of light went up in an arc from one of our
halted boats, and burst over Talon’s land force. It seemed
that thousands of figures were there on the land. They had
spread out from the road; over by the bluff, just beyond the
north end of the channel, they were erecting a huge piece
of apparatus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light flares died. But the gunners on our three boats
which had stopped in the channel had the range. I could
see the streams of their electronic needles, straight paths to
the shore. Dim violet beams, with white radiance where the
great metallic needles were striking Talon’s army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There must have been a chaos on shore. Then from a projector
there in the darkness, a great hissing rose. A yellow
glow, almost like the moonlight, became visible. It waved,
fanshaped from its source: a light that lingered, persisted in
the darkness, spread until all along that section of the shore
it hung like hovering yellow smoke, a barrage against which
our electronic needles launched harmlessly. I could see them
materialized into white solidity as they struck it, then flaring
red, and yellow as they fused and burned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gunners on our boats tried curving their beams. Some
were effective, curving in a great violet arc, up over the
barrage, or sidewise around its edges. I judged that some
were finding their mark, though the barrage was constantly
shifted to check them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene everywhere was now a chaos of flashing colored
lights. The girls who had escaped the black blast had
wavered, gone higher. Their bombs were falling wide; the
sea everywhere here was lashed into foam where the bombs
were bursting. A chaos of light, sound and smell: mingled
electrical hums, the pungent, acrid electronic odors, the hiss
of the flares, the sharp crack of the exploding bombs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls for a moment withdrew, off to one side, very
high up. They could not hit their marks; the black beams
from the rafts, now spread purely for defense, rose cone-shaped,
a cone extending widely over them to protect their
swimmers. The bombs, those few that were accurately aimed,
exploded in mid-air, as they struck the cone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A chaos of swift, simultaneous action was everywhere taking
place. Our great projectors on the flying platforms opened
fire, downward at the rafts. But now from shore a solid
black beam suddenly came sweeping out. It caught one of our
platforms. The birds fell. The platform, its insulation inadequate,
shriveled on the colorless blast, and went down, a
tangled mass of birds and struggling human figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beam swung. It caught another platform, and another.
All six—the only six we had—were surprised by it, caught
there, low over the channel, before they could escape. One
by one they were crashing down into the water. The last one
tried to dive; it was struck just as it neared the water level.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This black beam from Talon’s shore projector was raking
the channel from end to end. It seemed to have a range of
several miles—a longer range than any of our weapons. It
destroyed our six platforms, and then swung upward at our
girls. But they were just beyond it. They wavered as they
felt its effect, and then went higher and farther away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talon’s white light flares were now continuous from shore.
The scene was a dazzling glare of white, with alternating
periods of blackness. The black beam, guided by the white
flares, sought other victims. It swung on our boats, three of
which were bombarding the shore, the other seven heading
for Talon’s rafts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three closest ones caught the black blast full. It burned
through their insulating shields, as it had burned the platforms.
One boat sank like a stone. Another up-ended; the third
tried to retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But its animals evidently were caught at the water surface
and destroyed. It lay there, its needle-beam wavering.
Then it, also, was hit full by the black beam. It shriveled,
disappeared. The water down there was gruesome with black
struggling figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beam swung after our other seven boats. They were
headed to attack the rafts. They felt the beam but they
were farther away, and their side insulation withstood it. I
roared orders at them, and by some miracle my voice got
through. Alice answered me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Head back!” I commanded. “Around the island. Into the
east channel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all very swift. I had been fairly high and about
a mile away when the black beam began its deadly work.
It flashed by me several times, but my lone platform, with its
six birds, was a small, inconspicuous object. The beam missed
me; its handlers were evidently after bigger game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my ear Maxite’s voice sounded, “Keep the girls away,
Leonard! Retreat! Our land forces are too close!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I gave the orders. Maxite’s pink blobs of fire were constantly
arriving from Kalima. He had seen our disaster. The
black beam mounted on the shore seemed impregnable, unless
perhaps from the rear I could assault its gunners with
the Frazier thought-beam. I told Maxite my plan and he
approved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I swept back toward the Virgins’ Island. I would go back
and come up over the west mainland, flying low. I could
make such speed that in a few minutes I would be behind
Talon’s barrage. Talon’s rafts were all well out from shore
now, gathered in a group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I swung within a mile of them. Their black, cone-shaped
barrage was over them. They had made no attack, except
the one upward blast at the girls, and no attack now was
being made on them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During those brief moments when we had bombed them,
their swimming brutemen must have suffered severe loss.
Many dove, and climbed to the rafts. But some were still
swimming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rafts were heading slowly for the north tip of the
in the other channel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My birds were flying with tremendous speed. Occasionally
I passed wounded birds, and wounded girl riders clinging
desperately to them, trying to get back to Kalima.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sailed over the island, toward Kalima, and then turned
and passed inland above the road. Jim’s forces were drawn
up in an arc, extending from the sea, back inland some half
mile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heavy insulating shields were erected at intervals. The
projectors were ready, and our wind projector was erected
at the shore. It seemed a safe condition. Five miles or more
of open country was between this line and Talon’s black
beam. I could not see the beam from here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Talon’s yellow shore-barrage glowed clearly. Save for
that radiance, the scene up there was now dark. A lull had
come to the battle. The first engagement in which we had
been so decisively worsted, was over. A momentary lull it
was, while Talon seemed waiting to see what we would do
next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene was dark and silent. The night was darker now
as well. Black clouds obscured the moon and all the stars to
the north. And in the silence I heard a low muttering thunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I passed over our line, ordering Jim to remain inactive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” he protested. “Don’t I get in this at all, Len?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I kept him there. It was no time for us to plunge
recklessly at Talon. He had surprised our first attack and
worsted us in the conflict. I was not willing to try that again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flying low, I headed over the rolling hills for Talon’s present
land base. I put on my helmet, drew up the insulating
shields that lined the sides of the platform. At my wrist the
pulse-motor was throbbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I switched on the Frazier current, gripped the controls of
the huge projector. If I could concentrate my thoughts
enough .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with intensity enough. I was letting them rove
now, gathering strength. If I could halt that devastating
black beam, and then order another attack, all our remaining
forces attacking at once—</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my ears suddenly was Maxite’s voice, “I’m ordering Jim
to use the wind projector. Talon’s forces are making for the
island. We may be able to blow them away, toward the
East Channel, where our boats can get at them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind me I heard the hiss and roar as the great wind
projector got into action, a stream of expanding, heat-yielding
electrons flung in a path over the channel surface. A roar,
the hot air rising, the cold wind sweeping in; the channel
was soon lashed with angry waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had grown very dark. Black clouds edged with lightning
were coming down from the north. The thunder claps were
louder. I swept low over Talon’s lines. Groups of head clustered
on the ground, some mounted on the brutemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crowd moved about a huge black muzzle pointed diagonally
upward toward Kalima.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I passed close over it, a hundred feet up, but I hoped that
for a moment I would not be seen in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To my right was the yellow barrage radiance along the
shore. Large, bowl-like wire cages set at intervals of a hundred
feet. They glowed yellow, huge pots of the spreading
barrage light. Mounted heads were attending them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I dashed at one. I shouted, stood up on my swaying platform
and screamed with menacing words. The heads looked
up, surprised. The Frazier projector spat its intensified ray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Woodenly, the heads and the brutemen stood stricken; the
pot of light went out. I passed within fifty feet of it; my fire-flash,
effective at this short range, spat its tongue of blue
flame. The brutemen and the heads, the pot of barrage light
itself, shriveled under the blast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I swept along the barrage line, the Frazier beam preceding
me. From the other side, and from below, yellow rings
of fire darted up. They struck my upraised side-shield, and
the bottom of the platform. I could hear the crack of the
reports as they struck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The encampment was in confusion, thousands of dark, surging
figures. Small, black beams swung at me, mingled with
the fire-rings. A light-flare burst over my head. Shouts, a
rush of dim figures to avoid me; one of my birds was struck.
I cut it loose. It fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I was not halted; a minute or two of swift flight, the
barrage went dark as I sprayed it with the Frazier beam
and the blue fire. I came to the giant projector of the black
ray; it shriveled, fused. Its gunners vanished under my blast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The air was acrid with metallic gases and the smell of
burning human flesh. But Talon’s shoreline was dark, devastated.
Another of my birds wavered; I urged them all upward.
Fire-rings rocked my platform with their detonations.
But I was rising. They fell away. The shouts of confusion
lessened, melted beneath me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was over the water again, safe beyond the lines. The
barrage was gone. The giant black beam was destroyed. I
tried to tune in for Maxite, could not get him. But I got Jim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forward! Attack now! Swiftly, Jim, with all you’ve got!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I got Maxite. “Order the attack!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not get his image. My controls were disabled, or
the atmosphere was overcharged. But I heard his triumphant
voice. “We’ll get them, Leonard, get them now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The storm from the north broke with fury; no rain, but a
blast of wind, sizzling lightning bolts, and the roar of
thunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim had evidently abandoned his windblast. His forces
were dashing forward. A spray of the violet needle beams
curved up before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talon’s line was answering. Fire-rings were floating up.
Black rays were waving. The two lines, came together as
Jim’s army rushed forward; the rolling hills off there were a
confusion of darting lights and crossing rays, myriad mid-air
explosions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then it seemed that Talon’s line was drawing back, a
retreat northward. A yellow barrage went up to cover it. But
Jim rushed it; the barrage vanished. With some great projector,
Talon’s heads made a stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great ball of fire rose into the heavens, a tremendous
arc over Jim’s army, until it fell at the horizon. Fell on
Kalima? I thought so; There was a glare against the sky over
there. At five-minute intervals these fire-balls went up, bombarding
the distant city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya was fifteen thousand feet over the channel when
our second attack began. The storm was driving the girls
back; the birds could barely hold against the wind. The sea
far below was a turmoil of lashing waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our boats in the east channel started forward to try and
reach Talon’s rafts. But the rafts had blown ashore, were
wrecked on the north rocky beach of the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Angry waves dashed over them. The heads and the brute-bodies
were washed ashore with each white surge of the
water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our boats saw it. They dropped back into the lee of the
island, in the East Channel. The water was a little calmer
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Close along shore they hovered, and began raking the
island with their needle beams, a steady outpour of violet
streams, and blasts from the blue fire-guns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The island’s verdure shriveled, all along the east shore.
Then Maxite ordered Jim to set a projector on the west bluff.
It soon was sending a blue stream across the channel. The
west side of the island was raked from end to end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya’s girls were scattered by the wind. But she saw some
of them poised over the north end of the island where Talon’s
men were trying to land from the rafts. The girls dropped a
bomb, then another. The bombs were finding their marks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sonya urged her bird in that direction. But abruptly the
thought of Altho came clear and vivid to her mind. She had
long since given Altho up for dead, killed by our own weapons.
But he was not dead. His thoughts came to her with
sudden clearness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw the bombardment of Kalima finally halted. Jim, victorious,
was sweeping everything before him. His projector
still raked the island. The island’s vegetation was burning
now from end to end. On the north beach the huddled
figures were nearly gone; bodies were everywhere. The water
was dotted with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Along the main shore now, in advance of Jim, Talon’s army
was in utter rout. Frantic brutemen with mounted heads
rushed to the beach, plunged in. The heads were torn away;
floating like balloons on the white lashing waves. Back along
the shore, Jim’s men were lined. Needle beams darted out at
the floating heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everywhere we were winning. Far back in the country I
could see Jim’s triumphant lights, spreading everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the turmoil of water beneath me, a boat rose up, a
long, narrow black boat. Its cover slid back. It was heading
northward, away from Kalima, speeding swiftly, with a line
of bubbles in its wake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remembered it; the boat Jim had described. Talon’s boat!
Talon, who had been lurking beneath the surface of the sea,
waiting in safety for victory, so that he might rush for
Kalima. Now, with defeat, he was escaping. Altho, perhaps,
was with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned my aerial, trying to pick up Maxite. But I could
not get him. Then I tried one of our nearest boats raking the
island, ordered it to follow Talon. Behind me, far down, I saw
it turn and start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I drove my birds downward in a swoop for Talon’s boat.
Beneath me, close to the water I seemed to see the shadow
of a flying bird, but in a moment I had forgotten it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A breathless swoop and I was close upon the boat. From
the dim glow of its engines, I saw it held only four figures,
three mounted heads. Two were controlling the boat. The
other was Talon. I could see him moving about giving commands.
And Altho lay in the boat’s bottom, Altho, his body
lashed and bound into an inert bundle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Frazier beam struck the boat’s interior. The two mounted
heads controlling it stiffened and fell. But Talon was
untouched. I was close over the stern of the boat, holding
my projector downward. Talon’s face glared up at me, untouched.
His brute-body stiffened and slumped, but Talon disconnected
from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His head dropped to the deck upon his hands. His eyes
glared up at me. A flash of black spat from his hand-projector.
At this close range my platform crumpled. It fell,
struck the boat’s stern, and toppled half into the water. I
had leaped. I fell into the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But another figure had landed there before me, a giant,
fluttering bird. Sonya jumped from it, seized Altho’s bound
body. Talon’s small flash darted at her, but missed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My wrecked platform, half on the boat’s stern, weighed it
down. The boat began to fill with water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw vaguely as I leaped at Talon, that Sonya was
dragging Altho’s inert form to the gunwale. They went overboard
together. My hurtling body struck the head of Talon.
It cracked, smashed under my weight. I climbed from its
noisome, sticky mass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat was filling, sinking stern first. I dove over its side,
into the wave-whipped sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sinking boat sucked me under. But I came up. Around
me was a white, tumultuous darkness. Overhead the storm
clouds had broken into a rift; the yellow moonlight came
through. Something was floating near me, some wreckage
from the boat, a gas-filled pontoon. I seized it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind me, our boat from the island was approaching.
Then I saw, upraised near me by a surging wave-crest, a
human figure struggling. Sonya, struggling to keep Altho
above the water. I reached them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sonya! Here, hold to this! I’ve got him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sea animal went by us with a rush. Our pursuing boat
drew up; its black side was a wall above us. The insulating
side-shield rolled back. Anxious men’s faces stared down at
us over the gunwale. Arms came down and hauled us up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I heard Alice’s voice; and Dolores’s, “Len! And Sonya .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and the prince! Thank God you’re all safe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And from far over the land came the scream of Jim’s
siren, the signal of victory there.</p>

<div><h1>XVIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE GREAT RIDDLE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The homecoming! The return of our war-racked forces to the
city, with half its suburbs burned, and a thousand of its
people killed by Talon’s bombardment! I shall not describe
the cheers, the laughter, the sobbing. Victory in war can
seem to be so little better than defeat! All the paeans of
triumph cannot heal the maimed, or bring back the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was king no longer, for our prince now was ruler, with
Sonya for his queen. I was glad to be released. There is a
very false, a pseudo-glory, in ruling a nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Altho would not have me wholly resign. My promised
reforms, my earthly ideas of government, were needed here.
And so they called me premier, and thrived upon a crude
but humane version of what we on earth would call a
civilized government: a veneration of the aged, a new idea of
infant welfare, a monogamy of marriage with the surplus
women doing their rational work in art and industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of Talon’s thousands, fully half of them escaped back into
the mountains. They are there now. They will always be a
menace. But there is not a race of humans in all the universe
unmenaced by something. The very essence of human existence
is struggle. We do not think of Talon’s brutes now as
the Nameless Horror, and we are always prepared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was shortly after my marriage to Alice, that one evening
I came upon Jim and Dolores in each other’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” I said. “What’s this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed her again. “I loved her right from the beginning,”
he declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which was not exactly true, but I knew he thought so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had never seen little Dolores so radiant. “And I always
loved him, Len. You know that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did indeed. And she had never wavered in that love,
from the days when he had seized the little blind child and
whirled her in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our return to earth? We never made it. With Dr. Weatherby’s
death, the grave held the vital knowledge we needed
for such a journey. Nor did we desire it. Our lives were
cast here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often now, from earth, thought-waves reach me, tiny
earth, rolling on with a speeding time so much faster than
ours of this outer realm! Centuries have passed on earth. Of
what use for me to return—a primitive, savage being of
their past ages?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Civilizations have risen, held their peak, and declined.
Great cities have come and gone. Ice has been again where
once I saw the jungles of the tropics. And the ice has melted
again through countless ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new humans of earth often communicate with me.
Their thoughts are amazed at what I have to tell them. It is
all amazing to me, the great riddle of the universe. And I
think sometimes of that ancient earth-astronomer, groping
with the riddle, writing in his ancient book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Man, the little god of this earth, tied down to the
small star which infinite Nature gave him for an abode,
storms forth into immeasurable stellar space with his
thoughts.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From that little earth I stormed forth in body, beyond
the stars!</p>
